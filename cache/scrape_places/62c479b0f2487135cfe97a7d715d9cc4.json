Not only in Mecca, there are no transportation services available to the temples too. Why the government didn't give that I don't know. But you can get auto-rickshaws to go to mecca from hajo. N the rate is so reasonable. Maybe that's why govt didn't provide any transportation service as it is cheaper already. ",
