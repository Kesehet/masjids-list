The grandson of Iran's Abu Isa Affandi, one of the special engineers who built the Taj Mahal, has constructed the mosque.\n\nThe workmanship of Taj Mahal and this mosque is very similar\n\nThis mosque with 17 domes is in the Uparkot area of   the city, here 5000 people can offer namaz simultaneously, There is a separate arrangement for children to offer namaz here. It is also called Shahadari (three carpets).\n\nThis will probably be the first mosque in the country, where there are also 73 graves of martyrs of the revolution of 1857,\n\nIt is also called Ganj-e-Shahidan (the settlement of martyrs). Many generations have offered namaz in this three century old mosque.\n\nThe eighth generation is offering namaz in this Jama Masjid built 290 years ago, only become Mathura's Shahi Mosque Eidgah and also Shahi JAMA Mosque, theses Mosque's are so many years old around 460 years ago,\n\nThe mosque has a total of 17 domes.  There are three minarets about eight to ten feet tall on the main dome.  There are three small minarets built on each dome built parallel to the three domes.\n\nThere are also small minarets at the gate and four corners of the mosque. All are made of pure gold.  Remember that be it the minarets of the main dome of the Taj Mahal and the Hamayun Tomb or the Golden Temple, all of them have been coated with gold, whereas the minarets of the domes of this mosque have been made of solid gold. According to an estimate, the domes themselves contain 6 quintals of gold, It is gold.\n\nThe mosque is built on the top of the Balai Fort and is the highest point of the city, hence, it can be seen from all places of the city.\n\nThere are six maqams within the mosque where people can offer prayers.  The mosque has gone through several periods of renovation and reflects many architectural influences. The white-domed structure and beautifully carved minarets are distinctive features of Muslim art and culture.\n\nIn a question from the Indian TV serial \"Kaun Banega Crorepati\", Amitabh Bachchan had asked: - \"In which religious place of India, gold has been used the most?\"\n\nOptions were:-\n\n(1) Tirupati Temple.\n\n(2)Golden Temple.\n\n(3) Jama Masjid of Aligarh.\n\n(4)Kashi Vishwanath Temple\n\nJama Masjid of Aligarh is not only India but Asia's most gold plated mosque.\n\nhistoricalplace",

There are three small minarets built on each dome built parallel to the three domes.\n\nThere are also small minarets at the gate and four corners of the mosque. All are made of pure gold.  Remember that be it the minarets of the main dome of the Taj Mahal and the Hamayun Tomb or the Golden Temple, all of them have been coated with gold, whereas the minarets of the domes of this mosque have been made of solid gold. According to an estimate, the domes themselves contain 6 quintals of gold, It is gold.\n\nThe mosque is built on the top of the Balai Fort and is the highest point of the city, hence, it can be seen from all places of the city.\n\nThere are six maqams within the mosque where people can offer prayers.  The mosque has gone through several periods of renovation and reflects many architectural influences. The white-domed structure and beautifully carved minarets are distinctive features of Muslim art and culture.\n\nIn a question from the Indian TV serial \"Kaun Banega Crorepati\", Amitabh Bachchan had asked: - \"In which religious place of India, gold has been used the most?\"\n\nOptions were:-\n\n(1) Tirupati Temple.\n\n(2)Golden Temple.\n\n(3) Jama Masjid of Aligarh.\n\n(4)Kashi Vishwanath Temple\n\nJama Masjid of Aligarh is not only India but Asia's most gold plated mosque.\n\nhistoricalplace",

It was built in the early 20th century and holds immense historical and cultural significance.\n\nThe construction of the mosque was initiated by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, the founder of Aligarh Muslim University, as part of his vision to create a world-class educational institution for Muslims in India. The mosque was designed by Muhammad Aminuddin, a prominent architect of the time, and built by the university's construction department.\n\nThe construction of the mosque was completed in 1929, and it was officially inaugurated by Sir Ross Masood, the Vice Chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University at that time. The mosque was named Jama Masjid, which means \"Friday Mosque,\" because it was primarily intended to serve as a place of worship for the university's students and staff.\n\nThe mosque features impressive Mughal architecture with a beautiful marble facade and intricate carvings. The main prayer hall can accommodate up to 2,000 worshippers and has a spacious courtyard for congregational prayers. The mosque also houses a library, which contains a vast collection of Islamic literature and manuscripts.\n\nOver the years, the AMU Jama Masjid has become an iconic symbol of the Aligarh Muslim University and a cherished landmark of the city of Aligarh. It continues to serve as a center of Islamic learning and a place of worship for the university's community and visitors alike.",

It took four years and the mosque was completed in 1728. The mosque has a total of 17 domes. The mosque has three gates. There are two domes each on these doors. This Jama Masjid with 17 domes is in the Uparkot area of   the city, here 5000 people can offer namaz simultaneously. There is a separate arrangement for women to offer namaz here. It is called Shahadari (three carpets).\n\nThis will probably be the first mosque in the country, where there are also graves of martyrs. It is also called Ganj-e-Shahidan (habitat of martyrs). Many generations have offered namaz in this three century old mosque. It is estimated that at present the eighth generation is offering namaz in the mosque.\n\nThe eighth generation is offering namaz in this Jama Masjid built 290 years ago. Its domes are studded with several quintals of gold. No one has any idea of   how much gold is deposited here. [1]What is also special in this Jama Masjid is that there are graves of 73 martyrs of 1857-Gadar in Jama Masjid. The Indian Archaeological Department has also conducted a survey on this many years ago. This is one of the oldest and grand mosques in Aligarh. It took 14 years to build it. The mosque is situated on the top of Balai Fort and is the highest point of the city. Because of its position, it can be seen from all places in the city.\n\nThere are six sites within the mosque where people can offer prayers. The mosque went through several periods of renovation and shows many architectural influences. The white domed structure and beautifully carved pillars are special features of Muslim art and culture.",

Syed  Mahmood out of his affection with one of his friends Dr. Ross named the newly born baby Syed Mohammad Ross Masood. 'Ross' a Christian name is a part of Masoods' name because Sir Syed believed Hindu, Muslim, and Christian as members of one family and he did not distinguish among them.\n\nAfter Sir Syed's death, the whole responsibility of Masood's education was  entrusted to Theodore Morison, the Principal of M.AO. College who kept Masood with his family and looked after his education thoroughly. The family took special interest in him and it was because of their strict training that Masood did very well in the classroom and on the playground. In 1905, he matriculated and secured a government scholarship for higher education in England.  At Oxford he created a name in education and sports. He captained the Tennis and Boxing teams of this college and through Morison he had chance to move in the  higher English society. Masood earned his B.A. Honours in 1910 from Oxford and  joined Lincolns Inn for Law which he completed in 1912 and returned to India.\n\nRoss Masood was of the opinion that education imparted in mother tongue would be far conducive than the imparting of education in a foreign language. For that he wanted an Urdu University, already a plan for founding a University was in the process. He believed in the high ideals of the University. In his first speech in  Aligarh he said, \"I am sad to see the short sightedness of those who looked to the dreams of youth with suspicions. They did not know what importance a dream\nhas. This University, staff and students and the whole paraphernalia is the result of the dream of a selfless man. Remember, a nation which misses the power of dreaming does not have its goal, and does not try to give practical shapes to its scheme, is dead. Ross Masood stood for education in Science and Technology. Though a man of Social Sciences he was aware of what the teaching of science can give to a community with his untiring energy he persuaded the central government and the government of Nizam to give funds to the University funds, which may enable it to develop the teaching in science. Healthy brain in healthy body was the motto of Ross Masood. While he was busy in academic activities he did not ignore the physical activities of the students. In the beginning of 1937 his health further deteriorated and he passed away in July 1937. The dead body was brought to Aligarh where he was laid to rest on the left side of his grandfather. Perseverance, sincerity / discipline and devotion were the hallmarks of his character. He loved his students and was equally loved by them. His door was always open for .the needy and meritorious students whom he financed privately or from the Vice-Chancellors? Fund. He wanted Aligarh students to be examples for other. Students because of his generosity called him 'Hama Mahboob' Vice-Chancellor. He was a versatile genius and had full command over English, French, Italian, Arabic, Persian and Urdu but science was his major subject of interest and his untiring efforts.\n\nAbout the Hall & Residents\n\nSir Ross Masood Hall was established in the year 1969  in the fond memory of Sir Ross Masood, the grandson of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan. The foundation stone of R.M. Hall was laid by Professor K. A. Nizami.  Prof. Abrar Mustafa Khan was the first Provost of this Hall. The initial strength of the hall was 480.  It comprises of 4 hostel blocks namely Nawab Ismail Khan Hostel (A-Block), SadarYar Jung Hostel  (B-Block), Abdul Majeed Khowaja (C-Block) and Habibur Rehman Hostel (D-Block). Now 738 students are registered in this Hall.",
