There are strict and detailed requirements in Sunni jurisprudence (Arabic: fiqh, fiqh) for a place of worship to be considered a mosque, with places that do not meet these requirements regarded as musallas.[1] There are stringent restrictions on the uses of the area formally demarcated as the mosque (which is often a small portion of the larger complex), and in the Islamic Shari'ah (Arabic: shariy`a@, Law), after an area is formally designated as a mosque, it remains so until the Last Day.[1]\n\nMany mosques have elaborate domes, minarets, and prayer halls, in varying styles of architecture. Mosques originated on the Arabian Peninsula, but are now found in all inhabited continents. The mosque serves as a place where Muslims can come together for Salah (Arabic: Sala@, meaning \"prayer\") as well as a center for information, education, social welfare, and dispute settlement.[2] The Imam (Arabic: imam, Leader) leads the congregation in prayer.\n\nThe first mosque in the world is often considered to be the area around the Ka'bah (Arabic: ka`ba@, 'Cube') in Mecca, which is now known as Al-Masjid Al-Haram (Arabic: 'lmasjid lHaram, the Sacred Mosque).[4] A Hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari states that the Kaaba was the First Mosque on Earth, and the Second Mosque was the Temple in Jerusalem[5]. Since as early as 638 AD, the Sacred Mosque has been expanded on several occasions to accommodate the increasing number of Muslims who either live in the area or make the annual pilgrimage known as Hajj (Arabic: HajW) to the city.[6] Others regard the first mosque in history to be the Quba Mosque in present-day Medina since it was the first structure built by Muhammad upon his emigration from Mecca in 622,[7] though the Mosque of the Companions in the Eritrean city of Massawa may have been constructed at around the same time.[8]\n\nThe Islamic Prophet Muhammad went on to establish another mosque in Medina, which is now known as the Masjid an-Nabawi, or the Prophet's Mosque. Built on the site of his home, Muhammad participated in the construction of the mosque himself and helped pioneer the concept of the mosque as the focal point of the Islamic city.[9] The Masjid al-Nabawi introduced some of the features still common in today's mosques, including the niche at the front of the prayer space known as the mihrab and the tiered pulpit called the minbar.[10] The Masjid al-Nabawi was also constructed with a large courtyard, a motif common among mosques built since then.[9]",
