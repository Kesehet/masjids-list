This makes this place more sacred.\n\nThings to note before visiting this place.\n\n(1) Srisailam is 200kms from Hyderabad. By road it will take nearly 5 hours to reach. Plan to leave your place early.\n\n(2) Before entering into the Srisailam, must visit Sakshi Ganpati temple. It comes before the Srisailam city. Local believes that if you don't visit this temple, your visit to the Srisailam will be uncountable. Sakshi Ganpati temple is small and mostly remains crowded.\n\n(3) Book your stay in advance as there are very limited options available in Srisailam and if you ask local, they will add their charges also. We paid 500 extra per room.\n\n(4) Not much food options are there but ganesh food court is a good option to have breakfast, lunch and dinner. You'll get dosa, idly, vada, veg meal, fruit bowl, pizza, icecream and tea-coffee.\n\n(5) Quick darshan passes are there if you want to avoid the long long queue. 150 for Sigra darshan (1-1.5 hour), 300 for Ati-sigra darshan (30-35 mins) and 500 for Sparsh darshan (10-15 mins). Sparsh darshan will give you the chance to touch jyotirling. With these passes also you will not get much time to do darshan. These tickets are only useful for jyotirling darshan. Shaktipeeth entrance comes after jyotirling visit. If you want to go for a sparsh darshan ticket, plan to book it in advance. They have very limited tickets. Also confirm the time for the same.\n\n(6) Traditional cloths are compulsory only if your are going for a pooja. Still some of the clothings are not acceptable. Please visit the temple site to check the list.\n\n(7) Apart from the temple, other places can be visited. Shivaji temple, Nandi temple, Patal ganga & Akka Mahadevi caves.\n\n(8) For patal ganga, boat ride will be there which takes you to the centre of the Srisailam dam reservoir. Nothing much is there to do.\n\n(9) Visit to the Akka Mahadevi caves takes more than 8 hours. If you have a enough than only plan to visit it.",
