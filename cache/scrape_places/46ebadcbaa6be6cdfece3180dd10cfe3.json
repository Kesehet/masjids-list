In addition to the prayer hall, the mosque also has classrooms where Islamic education is offered, as well as a community hall for events and gatherings.\n\nOverall, Masjid Al-Ansar is a wonderful place to visit for anyone interested in Islamic culture and architecture.

It is the fifth mosque completed in the country under the Mosque Building Fund Scheme Phase I.\n\nThe mosque's official ground-breaking ceremony was officiated by Mr Syed Ali Redha Alsagoff, chairman of Lembaga Biasiswa Kenangan Maulud (LBKM), on April 29, 1979 and it was officially opened on September 2, 1980 by the late Mr Rahmat Kenap (MP for Geylang Serai). The chosen name Al-Muttaqin refers to the pious people who are ever aware of God the Almighty.\n\nThe Mosque serves the residents of Ang Mo Kio and it can accommodate up to 4000 worshippers after going through a major refurbishment programme in 2016. It has gone beyond its religious function as a place of worship to even offer a homeopathy welfare clinic. Besides that, it also offers part-time religious classes (Madrasah), kindergarten classes, marriage preparatory classes and counselling sessions.\n\nBefore the construction of this mosque, Muslims in Ang Mo Kio and surrounding neighbourhoods had to travel to Upper Serangoon, Sembawang Road or Thomson Road to worship. As there were no proper places of worship in Ang Mo Kio itself, the community would mainly gather at Block 715 Avenue 6 for religious sermons or at a former community club at Block 208 along Avenue 1.\n\nPlease note that visitors should remove their shoes before entering the mosque.",
