The historical city of Champaner was founded in the 8th century by Vanraj Chavda, the most prominent king of the Chavda Dynasty.\n\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is amongst the 114 monuments the Baroda Heritage Trust listed. The Jami Masjid is located about 150 feet east of the city walls near the eastern gate.\n\nIt is considered one of the finest mosques in western India with its elegant interiors. The ornamentation on the facade of mosques and tombs consists of symbols and motifs of the sun, diamond, pots, vines and lotus insignia, which were used in the earlier temples. The craftsman had imbibed their craft from their forefathers, who passed on the knowledge of Hindu, Muslim and Jain motifs.\n\nMahmud Begarha, born Fath Khan Mahmud (1445-1511), was among the most capable Sultans of Gujarat. In his long and prosperous reign (1458 onward), he expanded the borders of his domains, clashed successfully with the Portuguese, routed Malabar pirates, and established a new capital city at Champaner. Although his achievements laid a firm foundation for future rulers to build upon, his successors were not as capable. A mere 24 years after Mahmud Bergarha's death, the realm was annexed by Humayan of the newly-rising Mughal dynasty and lost any semblance of independence.\n\nIn 1484, when the Sultan defeated Chauhan Rajputs and occupied the site of Champaner, all that lay in the future. For the next 23 years, Bergarha spent untold resources rebuilding Champaner as a worthy capital of his domains, renaming it Muhammadabad. To those ends, he established heavily fortified walls enclosing palaces, mosques, gardens, tombs, and military garrisons. Although it was partly intended as a refuge for the Sultan in times of war, the city was not as strong as it appeared. When Humayan, the young emperor of the Mughals, laid siege to the city in 1535, his scouts were able to discover a deserted section of fortifications, allowing his soldiers to enter covertly. His forces then ransacked the city. Following his victory, the surviving population fled into the countryside, abandoning its buildings and surrounding fields. When a British surveying crew entered the ruins of Champaner in 1803, they found only 500 inhabitants in a city built for tens of thousands.\n\nThe mosque is located a mere 40 meters inside the city's east gate. It is oriented almost precisely east-west, with the qibla wall canted off-axis slightly to Mecca (although close enough to satisfy liturgical requirements). It comprises a rectangular main building facing a large courtyard surrounded by arcades. The front (east) facade is decorated with twin minarets, 36 meters high, flanking a central iwan with a five-meter wide opening. The octagonal minarets are deeply incised with horizontal moldings and small vertical niches infused with floral patterns. To either side of the minarets are flanking oriel windows supported by S-shaped Hindu-style brackets. The remainder of the building, extending to the north and south, includes two arches on each side, such that the whole ensemble reads as a five-part facade. Finally, anchoring the corners of the monument are cylindrical guldastas (corner turrets) topped by conical roofs.\n\nInside, the overall floor area measures 66 x 27 meters, about three-quarters the size of its antecedent in Ahmedabad. As is typical of congregational mosques the world over, the vast space is supported by columns, numbering here 176 in all. As the central mihrab can not be seen from all angles within the building (due to the presence of the columns), six additional mihrabs are placed on the qibla wall for the benefit of worshippers, three to each side. Short turrets on the outside of the west wall mark the location of each mihrab from the exterior.",

Kevada Mosque (also Kewda or Kevda) is a mosque in Champaner, Gujarat state, western India. It is part of the Champaner-Pavagadh Archaeological Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The mosque has minarets, globe-like domes, and narrow stairs. According to Ruggles (2008), nature was integrated into the Kevada mosque's architecture in a way that was unusual elsewhere in the Islamic world.\n\nThis mosque was built in Champaner during the time of Mahmud Begada, as were several other mosques, such as the Bawaman, Ek Minar, Jama, Khajuri, Nagina, and Shahar Ki. After James Burgess and Henry Cousens wrote descriptions of the Kevada, Jama, and Nagina Mosques, roads were built to reach them. The Kevada is notable because of its mausoleum. Kathra Mosque is west of the Kevada.\n\nThe mosque has many mihrabs, all intricately carved. There is a damaged brick tank for ablutions before prayers are offered at the mosque. The centotaph is square in shape with a fluted central dome and four corner domes; it is located next to the tank. The layout of the mosque is rectangular. Floral and geometrical designs adorn the niches. The tribate inter-columns are considered attractive. The prayer hall, a double storied structure, had three domes but the central dome has since disappeared. The windows have balconies built over pillars with intricate carved decorations. There are two minarets, which are also decorated with intricate carvings. Restoration works were carried out in the 1890s.\n\nArchaeological Survey of India (ASI) reports of 2006 indicate that extensive restoration works were carried out at the Kevada Mosque and also at many other monuments in Champaner-Pavagadh Archaeological Park, the Jami Mosque, fort walls, Bawana Mosque, Lila Gubaz, Sikandar Shah Tomb and Sikander tomb, which resulted in a slight increase in tourist traffic to the sites.",
