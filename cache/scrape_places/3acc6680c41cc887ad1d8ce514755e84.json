With a wide frontage and enough parking in the front and free space along with the Ilayangudi - Sivagangai highway, this Sufi Centre has gotten a very good place to establish.\n\nIt is actually built along with the house of an important person here in this locality, whose son built this Centre of Sufi order along with the residential apartments.\n\nThey follow a cult that includes extensive chanting of some hymns and appropriate dancing or similar movements, especially during mass programs and conventions. During Ramadan, this Centre functions as a one stop solution for those who fast.",

With a wide frontage and enough parking in the front and free space along with the Ilayangudi - Sivagangai highway, this Sufi Centre has gotten a very good place to establish.\n\nIt is actually built along with the house of an important person here in this locality, whose son built this Centre of Sufi order along with the residential apartments.\n\nThey follow a cult that includes extensive chanting of some hymns and appropriate dancing or similar movements, especially during mass programs and conventions.
