One among the places which acts like a hot-spot zone to get the peace of mind for worship and where you feel like getting closer to Allah during the worship.\nThe architecture of the place is also worth the experience.\nBut would like the administration committee to work towards providing better discipline.",

A place where you may feel your soul getting more empowered and I promise u once u visit u will never forget.A place where one gets peace while in supplication to Allah. One among the places which acts like a hot-spot zone to get the peace of mind for worship and where you feel like getting closer to Allah during the worship.\nThe architecture of the place is also worth the experience.\nBut would like the administration committee to work towards providing better discipline.",

Hazratbal, which means \"respected place,\" is a white-domed mosque at the heart of the main university area of Srinagar.\nThe shrine has a relic called the Moi-e-Muqqadas, which is believed to be a hair of the Prophet Muhammad. As per a legend, a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, Syed Abdullah, brought the relic to India.
