At entry point the person who verified our  ticket was so rude and harsh in allowing my attender. They are treating the people like beggars with harsh attitude. Around 3 pm they opened the cage, all people were rushing and made to wait at the entry point of main gopuram. After some time they allowed people inside the temple. Lot of pushing, some how had glimse of God. Volunters are pushing us to move fast so rudely. While coming out also so much pushing,with great difficulty came out.   TTD is saying that Senior citizen dharsan was a blessing to senior citizen but it is so badly organised. There was already lot of crowd in the temple before allowing senior citizens. While comming out, it was raining we want to sit near temple but no platforms or seats available near temple. We were drenched went to loddu counter it took 1 hour to get it, the staff were so rude, abruptly closing counter making people run from one counter to another.\nMy honest request to TTD to organise properly don't take people granted. Arrange some plotform/seats around temple to sit for people who comes out after having hectic dharshan.\nPeople are coming to Tirupathi believing in God. TTD is very rich by receiving donations and hundi collections. Please make some genuine effert to improve services. Don't treat people like goats.\nAlso in the name of checking  vehicles\nmaking people  to suffer/ inconvenience .\nKind request to TTD - Make honest effert to solve the genuine problems.

Stinking toilets with cockroaches and small insects.All the employees  are demanding money.Though camera is fixed, they are getting. Though there was no crowd in the morning,  we walked around 2 hour to reach the shrine. Which I feel is unnecessary.  Inside the shrine, why should the employees  touch the devotees ? Actually,  just like other temples people  can be allowed to worship. But I felt everything  was commercial.  Price of the laddoos was increased to 50 rupees and only 2 laddoos were given in the counter, which increased the crowd ( unnecessarily)Hope TTD looks into it and makes the devotees  feel happy",
