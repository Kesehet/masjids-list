I come here often because this is the only place I find solace from the hustle and bustle of the busy college life. One can meet many students here from NITA especially during the Juma prayer. There are at present two routes to reach here from NIT. One can either reach through the college gate near NIT Sports Complex (NITA Entry Gate 2) or from the college gate near Sankar Bazar (NITA Entry Gate 3).The shortest route from back-side of RNT Hostel Block 7 has been temporary closed. Hope the college reopens that route again. No doubt, I would definitely miss this place after my graduation!",
