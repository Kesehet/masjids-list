Therefore, it is important for every Muslim to know the rule of Allah Ta'ala and the order of Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) in every aspect of his life, follow it and think of spreading it to the people. Therefore, it is very important that a Muslim spend some time with his worldly occupations to acquire at least as much knowledge as is obligatory on him and try to acquire more and more knowledge and apply it.\n\nI pray to Allah Ta'ala that those who build a mosque and pray for it, may Allah bless them and pray for them..
