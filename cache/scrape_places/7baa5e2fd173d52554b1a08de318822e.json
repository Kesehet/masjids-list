It is believed that the mosque was built by the last Sultanate and due to the invasion of the Mughals; the sacred complex could not be completed as planned.\n\nA central window arch of the mosque remains incomplete as such stands walled with stones and the two structures at the entrance leading to the courtyard seems to be the two incomplete towers.\n\nIt is a Heritage Structure & under maintained by A S I.",

The moment I entered, I was captivated by the serene ambiance and the sense of history that enveloped the place. The grandeur of the courtyard and the imposing domes left me spellbound.\n\nThe Jama Masjid is a true testament to the rich cultural heritage of Ahmedabad and a place that fills one's heart with a deep sense of reverence. The attention to detail in its construction and the exquisite craftsmanship are evident in every nook and corner. The sight of the beautiful prayer hall and the finely adorned minarets is something that I will cherish for a long time.\n\nFurthermore, the cleanliness and organization of the mosque reflect the devotion and care of the people who maintain it. The surroundings were well-kept, creating a peaceful and inviting atmosphere for visitors like me.\n\nOverall, my experience at the Jama Masjid in Ahmedabad was unforgettable. It stands as a symbol of architectural brilliance and religious significance, and I am grateful for the opportunity to witness such a magnificent and sacred place.
