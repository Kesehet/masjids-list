Salutations to everything, Allah Rabbul Izzat has given us every single thing of such new beliefs, keep thanking Allah for it, pray five times through Namaz, you also pray, pray to others too and through exercise, pray Namaz five times.

This spiritual center is not only of great significance to the local community but also serves as the hub for the global Tabligh Jamaat movement. I had the privilege of being there to offer Maghrib and Isha prayers, and the entire experience was awe-inspiring.\n\nThe sheer scale of the gathering was astounding, with nearly 2,000 people congregating within the seven-story building. What struck me immediately was the diversity of the attendees, including a substantial number of international Tabligh workers. This truly reflected the global reach and influence of the Tabligh Jamaat movement.\n\nOne aspect that deserves special mention is the remarkable organization and management of the event. The volunteers working diligently inside the Markaz demonstrated incredible skill in maintaining order, ensuring proper space management, and guiding visitors. Given the sheer number of people present, their efforts were nothing short of commendable. The volunteers' dedication and commitment to their roles were evident, and their polite and well-trained demeanor made the experience even more pleasant.\n\nCleanliness, despite the large gathering, was well-maintained, which is a testament to the meticulous planning and execution by the organizers. This added to the overall positive atmosphere and enhanced the spiritual experience for everyone present.\n\nOne of the highlights of my visit was attending a speech by a notable Islamic scholar after the Maghrib prayer. The scholar's eloquent and enlightening speech left a lasting impact on me. I later learned that such speeches are a regular feature, occurring after each of the obligatory prayers, and feature senior Islamic scholars from various parts of the world. This commitment to spiritual education and discourse was truly impressive and provided a unique opportunity for attendees to gain insights and knowledge.\n\nBeyond the spiritual experience inside the Markaz, the area surrounding it was vibrant and full of life. Nizamuddin is renowned for its quality street food and restaurants. Karim's, a famous Delhi institution known for its delectable Mughlai cuisine, is just a stone's throw away. Exploring the culinary delights of the area added another layer of richness to my visit.\n\nIn conclusion, my visit to the Nizamuddin Tabligh Markaz in Delhi was an enriching and spiritually fulfilling experience. It showcased the unity and diversity of the Tabligh Jamaat movement on a global scale. The dedication of the volunteers, the educational opportunities, the spiritual environment, and the vibrant surroundings made it a memorable visit. I left with a sense of peace, enlightenment, and a deep appreciation for the remarkable work being done by the Tabligh Jamaat community. It's an experience I will cherish and hope to revisit in the future.\n\nNB: Isha jamat pryer is at 10 pm.",
