It was a great experience to see how people are truly devoted to all deities.. they go all together in family to say their prayers and ring the bells for blessings. There are also many shops inside and of course, as one of the main attractions in Rishikesh, is very touristic and you eventually will pay to receive a blessing (they put this sign on your forehead and give you a bracelet), but still is a very important and spiritual place for local people. \nJust make sure you remember where you left your shoes on the outside, otherwise you may not find them again  #india #rishikesh #teramanziltemple #hinduism #spirituality #travel #yoga #womenwhoexplore",

Situated on the banks of the sacred Ganges, the temple offers a sea of   tranquility in which one can begin to transform within oneself.\nWhen I entered\nParmarth Niketan, I was immediately surrounded by an atmosphere of peace. The Abbey's lush gardens with vibrant flowers and greenery create a harmonious environment that nourishes the mind, body and soul. The sound of the nearby river and the chirping of birds add to the relaxing atmosphere.\nThe Abbey offers a variety of accommodation options to suit all needs, from simple guest rooms to a range of luxury villas. Whichever you choose, guest rooms are clean, comfortable, thoughtful and convenient. It is a wonderful experience to appreciate the sounds of nature and the beauty of the Ganges.\n\nParmarth Niketan Ashram is known for spiritual classes, yoga and meditation, and lectures by spiritual leaders. Participation in these activities is transformative.\nYoga and meditation classes help me connect with my inner self and develop physical, mental and emotional balance. Spiritual teachings provide insight into ancient wisdom and practical advice for living a meaningful life. The daily Ganga Aarti ceremony at\n\nParmarth Niketan is a sight not to be missed. Praying to the holy Ganges on the banks of the temple with hundreds of devotees is a touching experience. Uplifting songs, air-filling light and spiritual satisfaction filled my heart with amazement.\nThe Abbey's beautiful surroundings offer many opportunities to connect with nature and find solace. Walking by the river, watching the sunrise or sunset on the Ganges, doing yoga in a peaceful place, these are moments of pure bliss. The ashram also organizes tours and excursions for tourists to explore the beauty of the Himalayas.\n\nParmarth Niketan Ashram's commitment to social and environmental issues is admirable. The ashram works on projects that protect the holy Ganges, promote education and provide medical care to the poor.\nEngaging in service work is a humble experience that allows me to contribute to the advancement of society while maintaining my own compassion.\n\nIn conclusion, Parmarth Niketan Ashram is a place for those seeking spiritual understanding, inner peace and general wellness. From its peaceful location to supporting spiritual knowledge, this temple is a haven for the soul. Whether you are a spiritual seeker, a yoga lover or someone who needs a break from the stresses of everyday life, Parmarth Niketan Ashram will support and encourage you beyond your needs.",

Rishikesh is home to several yoga ashrams where visitors can learn and practice different types of yoga. I attended a yoga class and found it to be rejuvenating.\n\nOverall, Rishikesh is a must-visit destination for anyone looking for a unique and enriching travel experience. It offers something for everyone, whether it's spirituality, adventure, or nature. The city's beauty and peacefulness left a lasting impression on me, and I can't wait to return.",

There was a bridge made of iron wires which was closed due to some reason at this time. The temple with a height of more than five storeys has been considered very famous in that area. The flow of 'Ganga ji' from under the bridge and the boat ride of people in the river is very enjoyable.\nAll of us could only go up to the four floors of the temple, but the sight of the flowing water from there was a delight to the mind.\nIf we all could reach the top of the temple, then maybe the limit of happiness would have been something else!!\n\n HAPPY JOURNEY ",
