Many people had occupied the graveyard around the mosque.\nAlhamdulillah, freedom was achieved from many occupations and a new magnificent beautiful building of the mosque was constructed.",

This sacred place is incredibly well-organized, providing a serene and tranquil environment for prayer.\n\nOne of the highlights of the masjid is the imam, who leads the congregation with great skill and devotion. Not only is the imam knowledgeable, but their voice resonates with a beautiful and soothing tone. It adds a sense of spirituality and enhances the overall prayer experience.\n\nOver the years, I have found solace and a deep connection to my faith while visiting this masjid. The community that gathers here is welcoming and supportive, fostering a sense of unity and belonging.\n\nI am grateful for the opportunity to offer my prayers in such a well-managed and spiritually enriching place.
