The roads are narrow and too crowded. But surprisingly I felt good about the crowd! Bargaining skills are highly valued here and one can get great discounts with good bargaining.\n\nI wish there was a bit more cleanliness here considering he fact that it is the icon of Hyderabad.\n\nBe prepared to face heavy traffic as you approach the minar due to narrow roads. I would recommend coming in an auto or two-wheeler to get the best experience. Also, be aware of pickpockets and thieves.\n\nThe market is amazingly vibrant, so make sure to explore the various bangles and artificers that are on display.\n\nOverall, a great place and a must visit!",

The view from the top is also quite impressive, offering a panoramic glimpse of the city.\n\nHowever, my experience was marred by the overwhelming crowd of street vendors that has taken over the area.

This will save you from the chaos of parking and the hassle of weaving through the street market. Be prepared for some persistent vendors trying to sell you various trinkets and street food, which can be distracting.\n\nIn summary, Charminar is a significant historical site that is definitely worth a visit, but the experience can be somewhat marred by the chaotic atmosphere created by street vendors.
