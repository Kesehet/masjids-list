These temples are renowned for their intricate and elaborate stone carvings, which depict various aspects of life, including gods and goddesses, celestial beings, animals, musicians, dancers, and erotic sculptures.\n\nThe temples of Khajuraho were built between the 9th and 12th centuries by the Chandela dynasty. At its peak, there were reportedly around 85 temples, but only about 20 temples have survived to this day. The temples are divided into three main groups: the Western Group, the Eastern Group, and the Southern Group.\n\nThe Western Group of temples is the most famous and well-preserved. It includes notable temples like the Kandariya Mahadeva Temple, the Lakshmana Temple, and the Chausath Yogini Temple. These temples showcase the finest examples of Nagara-style architecture and are recognized as UNESCO World Heritage sites.\n\nThe temples of Khajuraho are renowned for their exquisite sculptures, which display remarkable craftsmanship and attention to detail. The most distinctive feature of these sculptures is the inclusion of erotic art, which has attracted significant attention and curiosity over the years. These erotic sculptures are believed to represent the celebration of human passion, love, and the pursuit of pleasure as an integral part of life.\n\nKhajuraho attracts a large number of tourists from around the world who come to admire the architectural brilliance and intricate carvings of the temples. The annual Khajuraho Dance Festival, held against the backdrop of the temples, showcases classical Indian dance forms and adds to the cultural vibrancy of the region.\n\nVisiting Khajuraho provides a unique opportunity to explore the rich cultural and artistic heritage of India. The temples of Khajuraho are not only a testament to the skill and creativity of ancient Indian artisans but also offer insights into the spiritual and cultural traditions of the time.",

It is dedicated to Shiva, who is represented by the linga in the main shrine known as the womb chamber located at the heart of the building.\n\nHindu temples are designed along axis points that extend from the heart of the chamber upward through the line of the main tower (shikara) and outward in the cardinal directions. The main deity image is located in the central shrine, and the outside of the shrine and the exterior of the temple are richly decorated with sculptures. In some design schemes, one views the entire range of existence looking upwards from bottom to top, with plant and animal life near the bottom and the gods and semi-divine beings in various sculptural registers extending towards the heavens at the temple's summit. The steeply rising superstructure, and overall mountainous form of this temple are references to the mythical source of creation, the primordial Mount Meru, around which the world came into being.\n\nThe Khajuraho temples sit on very large platforms, and it is thought that originally there may have been a lake here beneath them. An association between temple sites and water is appropriate, as an essential part of Hindu worship is ritual bathing, required by the devout in order to purify themselves before entering the sacred area of the temple.\n\nThe majority of Hindu temples in north and central India were built between the Gupta period (roughly 300-700 CE) and the 1100s. The temples at Khajuraho are considered among the highpoints of classical Hindu architecture in the northern (nagara) style . This temple and more than 80 others were built by the Chandella kings, who ruled this area of central India between 950-1050 CE. Some temples, such as those at Khajuraho, survived because they were located in remote locations, removed from the conflict and warfare of political and urban centers. Even today, one must fly to Khajuraho, or take a full-day car ride from any other major city center.\n\nSome of the earliest Hindu temples were carved out of living rock and freestanding stone temples evolved gradually after that. Western-style arches and vaults were never used, but masons carved fine sandstone in numerous pieces, which were then assembled and sometimes pinned together using metal rods.\n\nThe Khajuraho temples are famous around the world for their fine statuary, many of which depict loving couples, sometimes in erotic poses. These images were disturbing to early European visitors, and even now confound many viewers. Scholars debate the meaning of these images, offering multiple explanations. One interpretation is that they show tantric ritual symbolism. \"Tantric\" refers to esoteric texts and techniques used in both Hindu and Buddhist practices that offer a direct path to enlightenment or spiritual release using the body's natural energies as a starting point. Thus, physical pleasure, and more specifically a controlled experience of physical pleasure, could be a path to spiritual achievement. Such imagery may also challenge to the viewer to move beyond the earthly experience of physical pleasure into higher spiritual goals. The location of these loving couples on the temple walls, between the meeting hall portion of the temple and the inner sanctum, seems critical to their interpretation.\n\nVarious esoteric and mainstream texts describe sexual activities and postures, including the comprehensively categorical Kama Sutra. It is likely that these erotic sculptures take such texts as the source of their subject matter. Aesthetically, these sculptures are highly sophisticated, expressing virtuosity in their rendering of human figures, expression and interaction, and an extremely imaginative vision of physical acrobatics.\nHar Har Mahadev\nJai Shiv Sankar\nJai Hind Jai Bharat ",

The temple has been classified as a Monument of National Importance by the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\nChausath Yogini Temple is believed to be the oldest surviving temples in Khajuraho, the erstwhile town of Chandelas, dating back to 900 AD. The name of the temple is derived from the Hindi word 'Chausath', which means 64. Legends state that the temple once had 64 yoginis in its 64 cells, who attended goddess Kali. Further, it is also believed that goddess Kali sheltered herself in the 65th cell. Only 35 shrines are survived now out of original 65 shrines.\n\nThe Chausath-Yogini Temple is the earliest building at Khajuraho and is situated on a low granite outcrop to the south-west of the Siva Sagar tank. Made using coarse granite, it boasts of an open-air quadrangular design that adds to its uniqueness. Chausath Yogini Temple is constructed on a huge raised platform that is located in an open place surrounded by 64 small temples. The shrines are tiny plain cells, each entered by a small doorway and roofed by a curvilinear sikhara of an elementary form. The shrine in the back wall, facing the entrance, is the largest and perhaps constituted the main shrine.\n\nThe temple ruins have no sculpture. Three large statues of goddesses, found among the ruins, are now located at the Khajuraho museum. The goddesses have been identified as Brahmani, Maheshwari, and Hingalaja or Mahishamardini. These statues are among the oldest sculptures of Khajuraho.\n\nTimings: 6 AM - 5 PM\n*NO TICKETS REQUIRED*",
