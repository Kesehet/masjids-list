On the same campus, there is a Mazar where you can also do Fateh prayer. Quran is available. Parking facilities at your own risk but yes on both sides of the road you can park so no need to worry if you are coming from your own vehicle as there is a spacious space to park your car or two-wheelers. Imam usually gets changed just because of poor management. Before making any kind of donation be careful it is better to directly purchased items and install them rather than paying the amount to any of them (This is my personal opinion and experience). After the namaz, you can find many vendors which are offering delicious biryani and juice outside. Near this Masjid, you can find many high-rise apartments and a marketing complex. You can message me or follow me to know more about this. The images which I have attached here, it's taken during the Friday prayer and you can observe the crowd outside, the parking and the arrangements. If you're wondering to pray namaz in Noida then this would be the best option. If you're looking for Friday prayer be there at 1 o'clock, and 1:20 is the Khutba time. During Ramzan, there are the arrangements of Taravi.",
