It was built in 1648 by Jahanara Begum, daughter of Shah Jahan, which is known for its minaret-less structure and special type of dome. Jama Masjid was built in 1571 during the reign of Akbar. Fatehpur Sikri was built around this mosque, which shows the importance of the mosque. The verandah of the mosque is very large and has Jammat Khana Hall and Zanana Rauza on either side. From Jama Masjid, one can see the tomb of Sufi Sheikh Salim Chishti, which is a wonderful example of artistry. The entire Jama Masjid is decorated with beautiful carvings and colorful tiles. Jama Masjid can be reached through Buland Darwaza. Apart from this, there is also Badshahi Darwaza. Its beauty is also worth seeing.",

This splendid monument is visible from the Agra Fort with the Agra Fort Railway station right between the two structures.\n\nThe Jama Masjid is built mainly of red sandstone and white marble that stand as a testimony to the magnificent Mughal architecture. It has a fountain at the centre and is supported by four kiosks in the courtyard. The interior walls have scriptures in the Persian style praising for Shah Jahan and Jahan Ara. The inlaid panels of work here are quite similar to that of Taj Mahal and are common to all the monuments and structures built by the Mughals in Agra. Every Friday, special prayers are conducted at this mosque which is attended by thousands of devotees. The Tomb of Salim Chisti is a part of the mosque compound.\nThe walls and ceilings of the mosque are painted blue in color.

All the bulbous domes have inverted lotus and kalash finials on the top and have narrow zigzag courses of white marble alternated by broad bands of red stone.

Still in use today, the mosque is one of the city's main landmarks, and serves as a useful reference point when exploring the crowded bazaars that sprawl from its base. These are laid out in a street plan that's barely altered since Mughal days. Jami Masjid is beautifully decorated with paintings, inlaid stones, carvings, and glazed tiles. The building comprises pillared Dalan, a beautiful 'Chhajja' and the 'Chhatri' on the roof. The main Iwan of the building is rather simple and contains a central arch with geometrical designs.",

Each corner of the rectangle is equipped with an octagonal tower, rather narrow, ending in a chatri (a type of typical Hindu kiosk). On the roof there are 3 domes, one in the center and two on the right and left. They are identical except for size, as the central dome is larger than the other two. They look like two drops of water on the dome of the shrine, with two decorations each.\nThe decoration at its base consists of two lines of geometric patterns, and one at the top is an inverted lotus. The lotus is a symbolic flower in the Hindu religion, denoting the continuity of life, human adaptation to his environment, and renewal. Each chhatri and dome has a bronze arrow pointing towards the sky.\n\nThe mosque has three entrances. The main entrance is in the centre, entered through a wide iwan (a broad, high and shallow gallery typical of Persian architecture) decorated with carvings of black marble on a white marble headband. These are Quranic inscriptions as they are on the shrine. There are also stylized flowers as in the shrine. They're made with pietra dura, which is a technique of veneering stones onto a stone backing (jeweler's inlays, for that). This technique was developed by the Florentines during the 15th century and it was they who came to Agra here to make these ornaments. The other two entrances are similar to the main entrance, but they do not contain an iwan whose decorations adorn directly above the door, so it is more modest. Both openings for the false window above, are both identical in doorways.\n\nThe rest of the walls of the mosque are richly decorated with marble. The decorations consist mainly of floral and botanical motifs, and sometimes simple geometric patterns. The whole is of great symmetry and the overall impression is nice. The Taj Mahal Mosque is of great beauty.\n\nInternally, being a mosque in use, it is equipped with the necessities for the practice of Islam: the lower wall has been given a mihrab, a kind of mihrab on a human scale surmounted by a semicircular vault. The imam stands at this place, which symbolizes the holiest point in the mosque. By comparison, the choir in the church, the place where believers do not give up. The mosque also contains a pulpit from which the priest preaches. The Taj Mahal's minbar is located on the right side of the mihrab. The covering of the mosque is made of rugs, and there are 596 places in the mosque. The inside is as ornate as the outside, and there are many Quranic verses inscribed on the walls in scales.\n\nThe mosque also contains a small stone chamber measuring 5.5 by 2 metres, which was used to protect the remains of Mumtaz Mahal during the few days before their burial, after they were brought to Agra. Finally, the basin in front of the mosque, between it and the shrine, is used for the initial ablutions for prayer.",

According to Jahangir even before the Lodi Sultans made it their capital, Agra was a big city (Ma'mura-i Kalan) with a fortress which was mentioned with high praise by the Ghaznavide poet Mas'ud Sa'ad Salman.\n\nThe emergence of Agra as a viable city probably coincided with the decline in the fortunes of Delhi after its sack by the forces of Timur.\n\nBut the greatest contributions to the city are by the Mughals. Many structures built by them continue to survive including this mosque that was once said to be the principal mosque of the city. The Kalan Masjid now popularly known as Kali Masjid was built by Nawab Muzaffar Khan(d. 1580) during the reign of Emperor Akbar.",

According to the inscriptions on this monument, the mosque was constructed in 1530, when Humayun ascended the throne.\n\nThe facade of the mosque bears five arches, the central of which is a high iwan. A dome tops the central nave and is supported on kite-shaped pendentives and net squinches. There are double-aisled wings on either side of the central nave. The building is made of brick and lime, and covered with stucco work.",

According to the inscriptions on this monument, the mosque was constructed in 1530, when Humayun ascended the throne.\n\nThe facade of the mosque bears five arches, the central of which is a high iwan. A dome tops the central nave and is supported on kite-shaped pendentives and net squinches. There are double-aisled wings on either side of the central nave. The building is made of brick and lime, and covered with stucco work.",

This mosque is not in active use for prayers but adds to the architectural and aesthetic harmony of the Taj Mahal complex.
