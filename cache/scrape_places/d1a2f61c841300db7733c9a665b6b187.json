It was built by the Mughal nobleman Roshan-ud-Daula during the reign of the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah.  It is located near Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib in Chandni Chowk, which was once a royal road leading to the Red Fort.\nThe Sunehri Masjid was built in the period 1721-1722 by the Mughal emir Roshan-ud-Daula, who was starting to rise to power in the court of the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah.  The mosque was dedicated to Shah Bhik, the spiritual master of Roshan-ud-Daulah.\nIn 1739, the Persian Nadir Shah invaded Delhi.  Standing in the Sunehri Masjid, he ordered the looting of Delhi, which resulted in heavy casualties and extensive damage to the city.\nThe Golden Mosque, built on a platform above street level, can be reached by a flight of steps.  The mosque is topped by three bulbous, gilded domes and has slender minarets.  The front of the mosque has three arched entrances.  The interior of the mosque is divided into three sections.  Stucco decoration work in the form of arabesques and floral motifs is visible in both the interior and exterior of the mosque.",

                    "review_text": "Sunehri Masjid (literally 'Golden Mosque') is an 18th-century mosque in Old Delhi.  It was built by the Mughal nobleman Roshan-ud-Daula during the reign of the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah.  It is located near Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib in Chandni Chowk, which was once a royal road leading to the Red Fort.\nThe Sunehri Masjid was built in the period 1721-1722 by the Mughal emir Roshan-ud-Daula, who was starting to rise to power in the court of the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah.  The mosque was dedicated to Shah Bhik, the spiritual master of Roshan-ud-Daulah.\nIn 1739, the Persian Nadir Shah invaded Delhi.  Standing in the Sunehri Masjid, he ordered the looting of Delhi, which resulted in heavy casualties and extensive damage to the city.\nThe Golden Mosque, built on a platform above street level, can be reached by a flight of steps.  The mosque is topped by three bulbous, gilded domes and has slender minarets.  The front of the mosque has three arched entrances.  The interior of the mosque is divided into three sections.  Stucco decoration work in the form of arabesques and floral motifs is visible in both the interior and exterior of the mosque.",
