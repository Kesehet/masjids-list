One can walk up to the entrance of this fort by climbing up around one hundred and fifty stone steps.  The effort is worth it.  The fort needs restoration and maintenance by the concerned authorities.  However, it is worth a visit. If further developed,  it could be a major tourist destination in North Karnataka. One can spend around half a day visiting this fort. Carry sufficient eatables, and compulsorily carry drinking water.  One can enjoy the fresh air and greenery above the hill. There are wind turbines and a wind power station too,  a little away on the hill, which can be reached by walking along a mud trail.  Bikes and tractors can be used to reach the top of the hill by using an alternative route near the Kaal Kaaleshwar temple (if you don't want to climb the steps). The Gajendragad town itself is now a taluka place,  a commercial place for the surrounding region,  famous for textiles.",

                    "review_text": "There is a fort (called Gajendragad killa) , named Shivaji Fort, which is built on the hills of Gajendragad town.  One can walk up to the entrance of this fort by climbing up around one hundred and fifty stone steps.  The effort is worth it.  The fort needs restoration and maintenance by the concerned authorities.  However, it is worth a visit. If further developed,  it could be a major tourist destination in North Karnataka. One can spend around half a day visiting this fort. Carry sufficient eatables, and compulsorily carry drinking water.  One can enjoy the fresh air and greenery above the hill. There are wind turbines and a wind power station too,  a little away on the hill, which can be reached by walking along a mud trail.  Bikes and tractors can be used to reach the top of the hill by using an alternative route near the Kaal Kaaleshwar temple (if you don't want to climb the steps).
