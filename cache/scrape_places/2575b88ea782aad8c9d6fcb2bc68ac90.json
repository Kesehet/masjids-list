Its three imposing domes rise elegantly above the landscape, while two towering minarets on either side add to the mosque's visual splendor and provide panoramic views of the city.\n\nStepping into the courtyard, visitors are engulfed by a sense of serenity amidst the bustling city.

The prayer hall, a cavernous expanse, showcases stunning prayer niches and marble floors that radiate an air of devotion and reverence.\n\nJama Masjid stands as a living historical monument, a spiritual haven, and a cultural emblem, drawing people from diverse backgrounds to witness its grandeur and experience its spiritual resonance.

It was constructed by more than 5000 workers. It was originally called Masjid-i-Jahan Numa, meaning 'mosque commanding view of the world'. The construction was done under the supervision of Saadullah Khan, wazir (or prime minister) during Shah Jahan's reign. The cost of the construction at the time was one million Rupees.[1] Shah Jahan also built the Taj Mahal, at Agra and the Red Fortin New Delhi, which stands opposite the Jama Masjid.\n\nThe Jama Masjid was completed in 1656 AD (1066 AH).[1] The mosque was inaugurated by an Imam Bukhari, a mullah from Bukhara, Uzbekistan, on 23 July 1656, on the invitation from Shah Jahan.[2]About 25,000 people can pray in the courtyard at a time .[3][4] The mosque is commonly called \"Jama\" which means Friday.[1]\n\nAfter the British victory in the Revolt of 1857, they confiscated the mosque and stationed their soldiers there. They also wanted to destroy the mosque as an act of punishment to the city. But due to opposition faced, the demolition was not done.[5]\n\nThe iconic mosque is one of the last monuments built under Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. After the construction of the monument in 1656, it remained the royal mosque of the emperors until the end of the Mughal period.\n\nDuring 1948, the last Nizam of Hyderabad, Asaf Jah VII was asked for a donation of Rs75,000 to repair one-fourth of the mosque floor.
