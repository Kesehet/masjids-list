                "answer": "roofless mosque, was built in 1589 by the Faruqi ruler, Raja Ali Khan (also called Adil Shah). You'll notice that the mosque has no roof - but the intersecting symmetrical arches create the ceiling. The facade has 15 arches and is flanked by two minarets that are 36m in height and quite plain in terms of design. It is said that the 'black stone' for the mosque was sourced from Mandu. The mosque has 17 mihrab niches. Mihrabs mark the prayer direction on the Mecca-facing (qibla) wall in a mosque. In one of these, along with verses from the Quran (highlighting the merits of constructing a mosque) an Arabic inscription reveals the patron of the mosque and the year it's construction commenced, i.e. 1588/9. The inscription states that the construction was completed in one year. The calligrapher Mustafa finds a mention in the end as well. But it is at the south end of the prayer hall that we see a bilingual inscription - almost a testimony to India's secular fabric. There's also a little note",
