Adjacent to this educational institution is a sprawling library, housing an extensive collection of books on Islam. What sets this library apart is its inclusivity, featuring materials in a multitude of languages, thereby becoming a beacon of knowledge accessible to a diverse audience.\n\nThe architecture extends beyond the prayer halls, with a meticulously designed sitting area that beckons visitors to immerse themselves in the world of literature. The intention behind its layout is evident--a space that not only accommodates reading but encourages it, fostering an atmosphere of reflection and tranquility.\n\nParticularly noteworthy are the Islamic classes held in the library on specific days. This community-oriented initiative further establishes the mosque as a center for both spiritual and intellectual growth. It opens its doors not only to the Muslim community but also extends a warm welcome to individuals of all backgrounds, making it a cultural and educational hub for Shillong.\n\nIn essence, this mosque transcends religious boundaries, emerging as a cultural landmark and educational haven.
