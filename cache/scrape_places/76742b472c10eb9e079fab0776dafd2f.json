The mosque's architectural design was nothing short of breathtaking, with intricate patterns and elegant calligraphy adorning the walls and ceilings. The interplay of light and shadow created a mesmerizing effect, further enhancing the ambiance of the prayer hall.\n\nThe mosque was meticulously maintained, reflecting the devotion and care of the community that worships there. The cleanliness and orderliness of the premises were truly commendable, creating an inviting space for visitors and worshippers alike. It was evident that great effort had been put into maintaining the mosque as a sacred sanctuary for spiritual contemplation.\n\nWhat impressed me the most was the warm and inclusive atmosphere fostered within the mosque. Despite being from a different religious background, I was welcomed with open arms by the friendly and hospitable staff and fellow worshippers. They were more than willing to answer any questions I had and engage in meaningful conversations about their faith and the mosque's role within the community.",

As someone who appreciates the diverse cultures and religious traditions that enrich our world, I was deeply moved by the ambiance, architectural grandeur, and the overall spiritual atmosphere of this remarkable place of worship.\n\nFrom the moment I stepped inside, I was immediately struck by the serene and tranquil environment. The mosque's architectural design was nothing short of breathtaking, with intricate patterns and elegant calligraphy adorning the walls and ceilings. The interplay of light and shadow created a mesmerizing effect, further enhancing the ambiance of the prayer hall.\n\nThe mosque was meticulously maintained, reflecting the devotion and care of the community that worships there. The cleanliness and orderliness of the premises were truly commendable, creating an inviting space for visitors and worshippers alike. It was evident that great effort had been put into maintaining the mosque as a sacred sanctuary for spiritual contemplation.\n\nWhat impressed me the most was the warm and inclusive atmosphere fostered within the mosque. Despite being from a different religious background, I was welcomed with open arms by the friendly and hospitable staff and fellow worshippers. They were more than willing to answer any questions I had and engage in meaningful conversations about their faith and the mosque's role within the community.",

The construction was done under the supervision of Saadullah Khan, wazir (or prime minister) during Shah Jahan's reign. The cost of the construction at the time was one million Rupees.[1] Shah Jahan also built the Taj Mahal, at Agra and the Red Fortin New Delhi, which stands opposite the Jama Masjid.\n\nThe Jama Masjid was completed in 1656 AD (1066 AH).[1] The mosque was inaugurated by an Imam Bukhari, a mullah from Bukhara, Uzbekistan, on 23 July 1656, on the invitation from Shah Jahan.[2]About 25,000 people can pray in the courtyard at a time .[3][4] The mosque is commonly called \"Jama\" which means Friday.[1]\n\nAfter the British victory in the Revolt of 1857, they confiscated the mosque and stationed their soldiers there. They also wanted to destroy the mosque as an act of punishment to the city. But due to opposition faced, the demolition was not done.[5]\n\nThe iconic mosque is one of the last monuments built under Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. After the construction of the monument in 1656, it remained the royal mosque of the emperors until the end of the Mughal period.\n\nDuring 1948, the last Nizam of Hyderabad, Asaf Jah VII was asked for a donation of Rs75,000 to repair one-fourth of the mosque floor.
