Although people come to Hazrat's shrine throughout the year, but on the occasion of Urs, the crowd of pilgrims from states like Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan increases. On the occasion of Urs, the shrines of Hazrat Qutub-e-Alam, Hazrat Sheikh Sadiq, Hazrat Dawood and Mamu Maula Baksh located here are illuminated. The procession taken out on this occasion is an important part of Jubba Sharif Urs.",
