This historical building is a unique symbol of religious tolerance. This is a huge mosque which was built by a non-Muslim. Today it is counted among the famous tourist destinations of Punjab. It has been constructed on the lines of the Grand Mosque of Marrakesh, Morocco.\nActually, Maharaja Jagatjit Singh of Kapurthala princely state had gone to Morocco in the year 1925. There he liked the huge mosque of Marrakesh very much. He decided to build a similar mosque in his state. Its construction started in the year 1927 and after 3 years of hard work it was completed in 1930. At that time, approximately Rs 6 lakh was spent on its construction. At that time, 60 percent of the population of the princely state of Kapurthala was Muslim and this mosque was a gift from the Maharaja to his subjects.\nThe interior dome of the mosque was decorated by artists from the Mayo School of Art, Lahore. A wooden model of the Moorish mosque is also placed at the entrance of the Lahore Museum. This mosque is a national monument, which is maintained by the 'Archaeological Survey of India'.\nIts magnificent artwork is similar to the Grand Mosque located in Morocco. The mosque, built on the design of the famous French architect M Monteux, has been protected as a national monument. This mosque is a wonderful example of French architecture. The verses of the Quran are written on it in Arabic script.",

Built by Maharaja Jagatjit Singh ji in 1930, the mosque is an exquisite testament to the love of the noble king for everything that he considered important to espouse his respect and admiration for various cultural and religious monuments.\nThe signature minaret and roofs are reminiscent of the mosques that dot the country of Morocco. In particular the Moorish mosque comes very much close to the mosque in Marakesh.\nThe walkway leading to the mosque once you enter the main gate is now full of whitish pebbles. I am sure it is quite a magical view in the presence of good lighting.\nThe corridors are very elegant and classy. It is not very large but gives you a feeling of generous space and room. The finely done carvings and sculptures are really great. I must also compliment the effort of the Archaeological Survey of India.\nThe neatly laid out lawns and landscaping outside has an unmistakable symmetry and reflects well on the meticulously planned and executed work on the inside.\nThe piece de resistance is the intricate artwork in the main dome. The ceiling artwork with the elegant chandelier gives an impression of an artful and delicate fountain about to spout water.\nThe calm and peaceful atmosphere is truly a tribute to the character of the mosque.",
