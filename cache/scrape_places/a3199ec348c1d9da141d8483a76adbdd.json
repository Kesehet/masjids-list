A mosque is symbolically very important to Muslims and is a humble way for man to recreate pure divine presence on earth. But mosques are not built according to what is believed to be divine patterns, even if they are divinely guided, nor after very clear rules, except on some few points. It shall have a clear indication of the direction of Mecca, qibla (kibble). The indication is in most mosques a mihrab, a niche in the wall. A mosque shall have a roofed area in front of the mihrab, and doors can be placed in the walls where the mihrab is not.\n\nMasjid (Mescit) is a word meaning 'place for prostration', and were used by the early Muslims for houses of worship, even for other religions. Today the Arabic 'masjid', and the English 'mosque' are used exclusively for religious houses in Islam.\nhe first mosque is the one in Mecca, meaning the area that surrounded the Ka'ba, the holiest shrine. But the model of early mosques was the courtyard of Muhammed's house in Madina, which was constructed in 622 AD. This was organized with a qibla, first facing in the direction of Jerusalem. To the left of this qibla, houses for Muhammed's wives were erected. There were three entrances to the courtyard. An area of the courtyard was roofed, and here prayer was performed. After 1,5 years the qibla was changed so that it faced Mecca.\n\nThis Madina mosque had social, political, and judicial functions, as well as housing Muhammad's family. The religious functions were mixed with other functions. Rules on prayers seem to have not been shaped during the first period, since the prescriptions of the Koran, came gradually in these years. Apart from the mosques of Mecca and Madina, one finds some few indications that there were other mosques in the time of Muhammad.\n\nMosques soon grew into becoming more complex, and uniform, in their shape. A minabar, the pulpit, from where the Friday prayer is held, was placed next to the mihrab. Within few years after the death of Muhammad, mosques became such important symbols, that when Muslim conquerors established themselves somewhere, a mosque was put up first, and then the military camp was built around it.

                    "review_text": "__The mosque in Islamic religion__\nHouse of prayer in Islam. A mosque is symbolically very important to Muslims and is a humble way for man to recreate pure divine presence on earth. But mosques are not built according to what is believed to be divine patterns, even if they are divinely guided, nor after very clear rules, except on some few points. It shall have a clear indication of the direction of Mecca, qibla (kibble). The indication is in most mosques a mihrab, a niche in the wall. A mosque shall have a roofed area in front of the mihrab, and doors can be placed in the walls where the mihrab is not.\n\nMasjid (Mescit) is a word meaning 'place for prostration', and were used by the early Muslims for houses of worship, even for other religions. Today the Arabic 'masjid', and the English 'mosque' are used exclusively for religious houses in Islam.\nhe first mosque is the one in Mecca, meaning the area that surrounded the Ka'ba, the holiest shrine. But the model of early mosques was the courtyard of Muhammed's house in Madina, which was constructed in 622 AD. This was organized with a qibla, first facing in the direction of Jerusalem. To the left of this qibla, houses for Muhammed's wives were erected. There were three entrances to the courtyard. An area of the courtyard was roofed, and here prayer was performed. After 1,5 years the qibla was changed so that it faced Mecca.\n\nThis Madina mosque had social, political, and judicial functions, as well as housing Muhammad's family. The religious functions were mixed with other functions. Rules on prayers seem to have not been shaped during the first period, since the prescriptions of the Koran, came gradually in these years. Apart from the mosques of Mecca and Madina, one finds some few indications that there were other mosques in the time of Muhammad.\n\nMosques soon grew into becoming more complex, and uniform, in their shape. A minabar, the pulpit, from where the Friday prayer is held, was placed next to the mihrab. Within few years after the death of Muhammad, mosques became such important symbols, that when Muslim conquerors established themselves somewhere, a mosque was put up first, and then the military camp was built around it. This was inspired by the Madina example, but in some principal cities, Muslims constructed their mosque in the place that was the centre of other religions.\nAt the beginning of Islam, tribes and sects in Islam, often marked their independence or their purity, by putting up mosques of their own, or by defining a certain part of the mosque as their part.
