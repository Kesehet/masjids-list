The minbar, a seat at the top of steps placed at the right of the mihrab, is used by the preacher (khatib) as a pulpit. In the early days of Islam the rulers delivered their speeches from the minbar. Occasionally there is also a maqsurah, a box or wooden screen near the mihrab, which was originally designed to shield a worshipping ruler from assassins.

Within a range of 1 KM (on all sides, considering you are in the center of the market near a Traffic Police Guidance Booth) you can go right,left,forward or backward and search for whatever you may want.\nI believe Friday or Sunday is the day when the market around the Mosque gets at its best and you can see small shopkeepers coming up on the street and place their shops at the best.\nAlso there is a Kaju Shake shop  on the right near the Traffic Police Booth, once you get tired after roaming around tha place, you should have one or 2 Kaju Shakes and you would have enough energy to go for another 4 hours without getting tired..\nEnjoy once you are here and let me know as well.\nKudos!",

The minbar, a seat at the top of steps placed at the right of the mihrab, is used by the preacher (khatib) as a pulpit. In the early days of Islam the rulers delivered their speeches from the minbar. Occasionally there is also a maqsurah, a box or wooden screen near the mihrab, which was originally designed to shield a worshipping ruler from assassins.
