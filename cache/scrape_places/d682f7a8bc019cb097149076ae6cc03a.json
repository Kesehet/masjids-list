Strangely however they are not required to cover their hair, which is a first in my experience.\nIt will cost you 300 rupees per device if you take any camera,smart phone,tablet or camera pen into the complex whether you intend to use them or not.

Men are frisked on the way in and on the way out to check if they are carrying any such devices. Very sinister and threatening behaviour and not at all welcoming.
