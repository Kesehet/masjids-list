This holy mission was successfully carried out by his Sanyasi successors and is fastly moving towards its goal by bestowing lasting peace of mind and tranquility to the makind and promoting universal brotherhood, so essential in this age of greed and selfishness. Selfless service to the mankind is the motto of this Trust.

Ashoknagar (MP), is an embodiment of spirituality, social services, truth and love and it adorns the State of Madhya Pradesh by its precious higher ideals taught by our Rishis of ancient past. All these activities are in furtherance of the mission of Shri Paramhans Advait Mat for bestowing peace, love and joy in the lives of suffering humanity through thousands of Sadhus, Sanyasis and selfless workers.\n\nThis Trust has always done its duty towards the nation and risen to the occasion whenever emergencies and natural calamities demanded. The Trust has been contributing to the PM's Relief Fund and Madhya Pradesh CM's Relief Fund quite liberally. The Trust has also been assisting various Social and Relief Institutions in MP as also in other States for promotion of social causes for the benefit of the general masses. The Trust, being secular in its approach, is also engaged in carring out humanitarian services in the field of education and medical aid by instituting schools, charitable dispensaries and hospitals, where free medical and surgical treatment is imparted to a large number of poor and needy patients irrespective of caste, creed and religion.\n\nFor the past 28 years the Trust is running a modern 150-Bed Hospital at Sukhpur on Esagarh-Ashoknagar Road (MP). The Hospital has full-fledged pathological and radiological diagnostic departments and modern operation theatres and an ICCU. The population being served in this region comprises mostly of Advices, scheduled casts, tribal and other backward and poor communities.",

The experience was truly delightful, blending architectural marvel with the vibrant essence of aromatic spices and tantalizing dried fruits.\nAs I approached Fatehpuri Masjid, the grandeur of its architecture immediately caught my attention. The mosque's stunning design, adorned with intricate carvings and delicate patterns, is a testament to the rich Mughal heritage that Delhi proudly holds. The sense of serenity and spirituality that envelops the mosque's courtyard is truly captivating, providing visitors with a tranquil oasis amidst the bustling city.\nUpon stepping outside the masjid, I found myself immersed in the bustling atmosphere of the spice and dry fruit market. It was an absolute feast for the senses. The air was infused with the tantalizing scents of various spices, creating an intoxicating symphony that enticed every passerby. The market's vibrant display of colors was a visual treat, with a mesmerizing array of spices and an assortment of dried fruits, all meticulously arranged in shops that lined the streets.\nWandering through the market, I encountered a treasure trove of culinary delights. The spice market boasted an extensive selection of spices, ranging from the familiar favorites like cumin, turmeric, and cardamom to the more exotic and lesser-known varieties. The shopkeepers were friendly and knowledgeable, eagerly sharing their expertise and recommendations for the perfect blend of flavors.\nAs I ventured deeper into the market, I discovered a cornucopia of dried fruits. From succulent dates and figs to mouthwatering apricots and raisins, the market offered an impressive range of choices. The fruits, meticulously arranged and preserved, presented a visual feast that reflected the dedication and craftsmanship of the local vendors.\n\nWhat truly impressed me about this market was the vibrant atmosphere created by the bustling activity and the friendly interactions with the locals. The constant chatter, bargaining, and exchange of culinary tips added a lively energy to the surroundings, making it an unforgettable cultural experience.\nVisiting the Fatehpuri Masjid and the adjacent spice and dry fruit market is an absolute must for anyone with a love for history, architecture, and the culinary arts. It offers a harmonious blend of the sacred and the sensory, allowing visitors to appreciate the rich heritage of Delhi while immersing themselves in a cornucopia of flavors.\nOverall, my visit to Fatehpuri Masjid and the biggest spice and dry fruit market of Delhi was nothing short of delightful. I highly recommend taking the time to explore this fascinating destination, where the allure of history and the aromatic delights of spices and dried fruits combine to create an enchanting experience for all who visit.",
