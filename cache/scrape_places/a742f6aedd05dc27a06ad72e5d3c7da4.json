Though being small in number of rows (saff) in a single floor, this masjid stands tall stands tall enough containing 4 floors (G+3) such that it can accommodate musallis in fridays and eids. The ground floor is air conditioned and also has a water cooler installed.\n\nThe masjid also runs the holy movement of tabligh jamat. This responsibility has been taken up by a couple of musallis residing around the masjid. These people have spent their time in tabligh for 4 months and 40 days. There are also countless number of people who have spent 3 days in tabligh jamat. Most of these people are currently active in pouring their efforts for the masjid and its musallis. These people commonly called as 'masjidwaar jamat', gather daily after namaz-e-isha and attend taleem of fazail-e-amaal and muntakhab ahadees, after which they conduct daily catch up meeting (mashwara) which looks upon various issues of tabligh jamat to be run in that particular area. This is followed by (meeting brothers outside the masjid) or mulaqaat for 2.5 hours. The masjidwaar jamat also conducts weekly 2 gashts, the time for which is generally asr to maghrib. The masjidwaar jamat also goes on 3 day monthly jamat (where different people have their weeks fixed - 1st, 2nd,3rd or 4th).\n\nBe a part of this holy movement if you live around this masjid. This will be helpful insha Allah in giving you success in this world and the Hereafter.\n\nDo visit the masjid and offer your namaz with jamat (congregation) or nafil, whichever is the need of the hour, follow the commandments of Allah and his Rasool Sallallahu alaihi wasallam, be a good muslim, propagate deen-e-islam and prepare yourself for the aakhirah!",
