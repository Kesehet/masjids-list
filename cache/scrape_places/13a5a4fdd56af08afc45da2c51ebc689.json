The mosque is one of the best places to visit in Delhi for anyone who loves history, art, or spirituality. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to experience the grace and glory of Mahadi Masjid Delhi.I was impressed by its architecture and history. The mosque is situated in the Archaeological Survey Park, about 500 meters south of Tomb and Mosque of Maulana Jamali Kamali. The mosque bears a strong resemblance with the Bara Gumbad Masjid of Lodi period. The mosque has a unique characteristic of an open wall mosque as well as a covered mosque. The flat roofed chambers of the mosque have been adorned with coloured tiles. The roofs have been adorned with arched openings. There are three central bays on the walls of the mosque. The courtyard has been well enclosed with strong walls and has turrets in each corner. The mosque thus looks like a miniature fortress.",

Most notable is the dome that looks a shoddy work done by low-skilled masons in a hurry to give it a look different.\n\nThe Masjid is in tiptop condition right from the entrance and the ASI also has posted a full-time security guard who shared little of the thing-or-two he knows about the monument. After climbing the stairs and a majestic entrance as seen in the photo above there is a vast empty space and a wall at the end. There is also a nicely constructed well which is covered properly for safety.\n\nThe Masjid is tucked away in the woods and there is only a narrow road in a good condition that goes to the Mehrauli town. As a result the Masjid premises are peaceful and silent as almost no one visits this little monument on weekdays. Mehrauli in turn is a corrupt word for Mihiravali meaning the residence of Varah Mihir a 10th century Indian Astronomer who lived in this area.\n\n Accessibility Features:\nNo=Ramp access.\nNo=A wheelchair-accessible Entrance.\nYes=A wheelchair-accessible Restroom/Toilet.\nNo=A wheelchair-accessible Seating.\nYes=A wheelchair-accessible Parking.",
