As someone who appreciates the diverse cultures and religious traditions that enrich our world, I was deeply moved by the ambiance, architectural grandeur, and the overall spiritual atmosphere of this remarkable place of worship.\n\nFrom the moment I stepped inside, I was immediately struck by the serene and tranquil environment. The mosque's architectural design was nothing short of breathtaking, with intricate patterns and elegant calligraphy adorning the walls and ceilings. The interplay of light and shadow created a mesmerizing effect, further enhancing the ambiance of the prayer hall.\n\nThe mosque was meticulously maintained, reflecting the devotion and care of the community that worships there. The cleanliness and orderliness of the premises were truly commendable, creating an inviting space for visitors and worshippers alike. It was evident that great effort had been put into maintaining the mosque as a sacred sanctuary for spiritual contemplation.\n\nWhat impressed me the most was the warm and inclusive atmosphere fostered within the mosque. Despite being from a different religious background, I was welcomed with open arms by the friendly and hospitable staff and fellow worshippers. They were more than willing to answer any questions I had and engage in meaningful conversations about their faith and the mosque's role within the community.",

The mosque is believed to be inspired by Jama Masjid in Chandni Chowk, built by her illustrious and much loved grandfather, Shah Jahan. Though much smaller in scale, and barely ever visited by travellers to the city, the mosque still stands on it's own - looking glorious, despite obvious signs of decay.\n\nZeenat-ul ghata Masjid old delhi\nThe sun setting behind the mosque\n\nZeenat-ul ghata Masjid old delhi\nInside the mosque\n\nThe mosque is located at Shahjahanabad in Daryaganj, which used to be the heart of the old Mughal capital. Now here's an interesting anecdote about the locality itself - Daryaganj was originally designed to be a market next to the river Yamuna, the lifeline of Delhi. However, once the British took control of Delhi they made several changes, including rerouting of the river. Unfortunately with this change in the course of river (darya), the market was no longer next to the river, though the name continued to be used.\n\nI digress, as I always do when I tell tales from the past. Well, let's try and answer why it's called Ghata Masjid. There are actually two theories around it. The first one is about it's tall minarets which reach the clouds or ghata (not literally, of course), and the second story is about the banks of river Yamuna with it's ghat (steps leading to the river). Maybe there is another story too, but it doesn't really matter - the name has stuck, even though some people call it ghaata (loss) masjid too.\n\nThe mosque saw some dark times during India's first independence struggle in 1857 when the Mughal rulers in Delhi joined the revolt against the British. Unfortunately, the war was lost and with that the Mughal empire in India came to an end. Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal, was exiled to Rangoon (Burma or Myanmar used to be a part of British India then) and large parts of Delhi were completely destroyed, including almost everything inside the Red Fort. The mosque wasn't razed to the ground, but the British decided to convert it into a bakery.

She was Aurangzeb's favourite wife and her story takes us all the way to Deccan where she was buried in the majestic Bibi ka Maqbara in Aurangabad. Here's the interesting bit - the mosque built by her was a miniature version of Jama Masjid in Delhi, while Bibi ka Maqbara is a miniature version of Taj Mahal in Agra. What's even more interesting is the fact that both were built by Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb's father, who was thrown off from his throne by Aurangzeb himself and leter imprisoned till death in Agra's Red Fort.\n\nSuch are the fascinating tales from the Mughal era.
