From the main gate, if you stand on the stairs.. you can see all the hustle bustle of the market. The mosque is a beauty. You'll love the architecture. It's visible from nearby places so you won't find it difficult to get here. Enjoy.",

The Jama Masjid was regarded as a symbolic gesture of Islamic power across India well into the colonial era. The mosque predominantly uses red sandstone and is set apart from its predecessors by more extensive usage of white marble. Black marble also features as a decorative element. It is situated on a plinth elevated 10 meters above the surrounding city. The square sahn (courtyard) is paved with red sandstone and faces the eastern gate. It has a side length of at least 99 m and can accommodate 25,000 Muslims. The prayer hall measures 61 meters in length and 27 meters in breadth. Three marble domes rise up from its roof, featuring golden finials. The facade of the prayer hall features a grand pishtaq in the center, flanked by five smaller, cusped archways on either side. Above each archway of the prayer hall are some calligraphic pieces. The hall's interior bears seven mihrabs (prayer niches) on the western qibla wall, corresponding to the seven bays into which the hall is divided. The central mihrab is intricately decorated and clad in marble, with a marble minbar (pulpit) lying to its right. The hall is floored with white and black ornamented marble to look like a Muslim prayer mat.",

Stepping into the mosque's premises, I was immediately struck by its grandeur and serene ambiance.\n\nThe Begumpur Mosque, located in the Mehrauli area of Delhi, is a magnificent structure that dates back to the 14th century. As I explored its vast courtyard and intricate architecture, I couldn't help but marvel at the mastery and craftsmanship that went into its construction.\n\nThe mosque's defining feature is its imposing rectangular prayer hall, adorned with beautiful arched entrances and soaring domes. The intricately carved stone walls, adorned with intricate patterns and calligraphy, added a touch of timeless elegance to the surroundings. It was a sight to behold, truly showcasing the architectural brilliance of the bygone era.\n\nWalking through the halls and corridors, I could feel the weight of history and spirituality that resonated within the mosque's walls. The tranquility of the space, coupled with the gentle echoes of prayers, created a serene and contemplative atmosphere that enveloped me.\n\nOne of the highlights of my visit was ascending the minaret, which offered a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding area. From this vantage point, I could see the sprawling cityscape of Delhi, a fusion of ancient and modern, seamlessly blending together.\n\nI was also impressed by the meticulous preservation efforts that have been undertaken to maintain the mosque's authenticity. Despite its age, the Begumpur Mosque stands as a proud symbol of Delhi's architectural legacy and serves as a reminder of the city's rich cultural heritage.\n\nVisiting the Begumpur Mosque was a truly enriching experience. It provided a glimpse into the past, allowing me to appreciate the architectural brilliance and cultural significance that it represents. Whether you are an architecture enthusiast, a history buff, or simply seeking a serene space for contemplation, the Begumpur Mosque is a must-visit destination in Delhi. It offers a glimpse into the city's glorious past and invites visitors to immerse themselves in its timeless beauty.",

The cabinet located in the north gate has a collection of relics of Muhammad - the Quran written on deerskin, a red beard-hair of the prophet, his sandals and his footprints embedded in a marble block.[1]\n\nThe floor plan of the mosque is similar to that of the Jama Masjid of Agra.[12] It is covered with white and black ornamented marble to look like a Muslim prayer mat. Beside it, a thin black border measuring 3 feet (0.91 m) long and 1.5 feet (0.46 m) wide is marked for the Muslim worshippers. There are 899 total such boxes.[15] The architecture and plan of Badshahi Masjid which was built by Shah Jahan's son Aurangzeb in Lahore is closely related to that of the mosque.

It has served as a place of worship, congregation, and spiritual solace for generations of residents and visitors.\n\nStrategic Location:\n\nThe mosque's location within the Upper Fort highlights its strategic importance as part of the fortification complex. The Upper Fort was designed to provide a vantage point for military defense and surveillance of the surrounding areas.\n\nPreservation and Restoration:\n\nLike many historical monuments, the Jama Masjid in the Upper Fort has undergone periods of preservation and restoration over the years to maintain its structural integrity and architectural grandeur. Efforts have been made to ensure that the mosque remains a testament to Aligarh's rich history and cultural heritage.\n\nUnity and Identity:\n\nThe Jama Masjid in the Upper Fort stands as a symbol of unity, faith, and shared history, representing the diverse cultural and religious fabric of Aligarh. It has witnessed generations of worshippers and visitors, contributing to the city's cultural and social identity.\n\nToday's Significance:\n\nWhile specific historical records about the mosque's construction and developments may be limited, the Jama Masjid in Aligarh's Upper Fort continues to be a revered site for worshippers, tourists, and history enthusiasts. It remains an architectural marvel that offers insights into the Mughal era's art and culture, as well as its strategic significance within the context of the Upper Fort.\n\nVisiting the Jama Masjid in Aligarh's Upper Fort provides an opportunity to appreciate the historical, architectural, and cultural legacy of the city and its enduring connection to the past.",

Built by Nawab Mohammad Ali Shah Bahadur in the year 1839, Jama Masjid is one of the oldest historical landmarks in Lucknow. Along with being a popular tourist site, it also serves as an important religious centre in Lucknow for the Muslim community.

Though, there is inside kitchen in the hotel and room service is available. The hotel meal charge is compatibly higher. But, there meal is delicious.\n\nThe room is neat and clean. Enough space in the room. We get TV, AC, Wardrobe, dressing table and shoe case in the room. Furniture is new. But washroom utensils are old. The cleaner tries to washroom clean but its tiles are a little bit old. So we found some spots in the washroom. Moreover, the geyser is not working in our washroom.\n\nThe staff are cordial and helpful. They always respond to any issues quickly. They also help me to guide how to tour in Delhi and buying gadget.\n\nTo sum up, if you are looking for budget hotel for family, this hotel is recommended. As it is a budget hotel, it has some limitation, so before booking you should consider that limitation.",

Though, there is inside kitchen in the hotel and room service is available. The hotel meal charge is compatibly higher. But, there meal is delicious.\n\nThe room is neat and clean. Enough space in the room. We get TV, AC, Wardrobe, dressing table and shoe case in the room. Furniture is new. But washroom utensils are old. The cleaner tries to washroom clean but its tiles are a little bit old. So we found some spots in the washroom. Moreover, the geyser is not working in our washroom.\n\nThe staff are cordial and helpful. They always respond to any issues quickly. They also help me to guide how to tour in Delhi and buying gadget.\n\nTo sum up, if you are looking for budget hotel for family, this hotel is recommended. As it is a budget hotel, it has some limitation, so before booking you should consider that limitation.",
