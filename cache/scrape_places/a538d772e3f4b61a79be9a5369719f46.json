The imam and members of the mosque were gracious and accommodating, eager to share their knowledge and engage in dialogue.\n\nOverall, Qadri Masjid is not only a place of worship but a center of cultural and spiritual enrichment. It serves as a bridge between tradition and modernity, inviting people from all walks of life to explore its beauty and learn about the Islamic heritage.
