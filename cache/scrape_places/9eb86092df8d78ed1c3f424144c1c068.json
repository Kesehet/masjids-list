It is a beautiful space for picnicking, hanging out, or just escaping the noise and hustle and bustle of Delhi. There is a small lake just outside the fort where one can get paddle boats. This is a great place to come with family and / or chill. It can get quite busy on the weekend. Definitely one of the destinations to visit if you are in Delhi.",
