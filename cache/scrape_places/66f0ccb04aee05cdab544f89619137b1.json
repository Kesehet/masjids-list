Here there is a place for Friday Namaj inside where people come for prayer.\n\nIt's a rich piece of history dated back 200 years and lots of things coming from Belgium during that era. There is a long alley of places for people.\n\nThere is a clock tower too which beats till now from the past 200 years. There are a lot of stairs you need to climb for that.\n\nLocation wise it's just beside Hooghly ghat station and various toto and auto available all the time. Overall great and I loved it.",

Here there is a place for Friday Namaj inside where people come for prayer.\n\nIt's a rich piece of history dated back 200 years and lots of things coming from Belgium during that era. There is a long alley of places for people.\n\nThere is a clock tower too which beats till now from the past 200 years. There are a lot of stairs you need to climb for that.\n\nLocation wise it's just beside Hooghly ghat station and various toto and auto available all the time. Overall great and I loved it.",

The old Fauti Masjid is one of the largest mosques in the town of Kumarpur and Murshidabad district. It is about 3 quarters of a mile away from the grand and famous Hazarduari Palace.This grand mosque is 135 feet long and 38 feet broad. The mosque at present is in ruins and has been overgrown by a jungle nearby. It may fall any moment.\nNo decent way to enter, you have to go around the jungle. Fauti name comes from the Hole in the Dome. Thrilling altogether. Surprisingly you will not get any proper guide. You can give few bucks to the local kids and they will tell you the history behind it. But it's a good place. Can give it a try. Since there is no security or proper guards, you can touch the walls.",

                    "review_text": "Fauti Mosque is a mosque at Kumarpur in the Lalbag subdivision of Murshidabad district in West Bengal, India. It was built by Nawab Sarfaraz Khan in 1740 AD. The old Fauti Masjid is one of the largest mosques in the town of Kumarpur and Murshidabad district. It is about 3 quarters of a mile away from the grand and famous Hazarduari Palace.This grand mosque is 135 feet long and 38 feet broad. The mosque at present is in ruins and has been overgrown by a jungle nearby. It may fall any moment.\nNo decent way to enter, you have to go around the jungle. Fauti name comes from the Hole in the Dome. Thrilling altogether. Surprisingly you will not get any proper guide. You can give few bucks to the local kids and they will tell you the history behind it. But it's a good place. Can give it a try. Since there is no security or proper guards, you can touch the walls.",
