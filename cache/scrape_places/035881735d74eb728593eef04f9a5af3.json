                    "review_id": "SIRHIND SHARIF, PUNJAB, INDIA.\n(Rauza Sharif)\n\nShaikh Ahmad al-Faruqi al-Sirhindi Dargah (popularly known as Mujaddid, Alf-Sani),  is situated on the Sirhind-Bassi Pathana Road at a small distance to the north of Gurdwara Fatehgarh Sahib. Sheikh Ahmed Farooqi lived at this place during the times of Akbar and Jahangir from 1563 to 1624.\nThe religious importance of Sirhind is high because it is a famous pilgrimage site for Sikhs and Muslims. Here is the famous Gurdwara Fatehgarh Sahib of Sikhs.\nHazrat Mujaddid-i-Alam-i-Sani (RA) was born in a place called 'Sirhind' in Fatehgarh Tehsil of East Punjab. This place is located in the northwest corner of India and on the eastern border of Pakistan. At that time this place was covered with deep forest. The word 'Sirhind' is a corruption of 'Seherbind'. In Hindi the word 'seher' means lion, and 'rind' means - lion forest or lion habitat or lion habitat forest. In later times, lion-men like Hazrat Shaykh Imam Rabbani Mujaddid-e Alf-e-Sani (R.A.) were born here, which proved the validity of naming this place. Needless to say, this place is located midway between Delhi and Lahore.\nHistorian Maulana Muhammad Abdul Halim Sahib in one of his books 'Mujaddide Azam' mentioned: \"Once during the reign of Feroze Shah Tughlaq, a dozen royal servants were going from Lahore to Delhi with government funds. Among them was an old man with clairvoyance. When they reached the forest called 'Sirhind' on their way, the old man knew by his spiritual power that in the near future that place would be enriched by the feet of a great man. Later that elder discussed the matter with Hazrat Syed Jalaluddin Bukhari aka Makhdum Jahania, a murshid of Firoz Shah. He was particularly moved on hearing this incident and informed the king. That, since the year 760 A.H., there has been a continuous revelation in our Tariqah that a thousand years after the time of the Prophet (PBUH), an old man will be born in Hindustan, who will be the Imam and Mujaddid of this age, and full of the virtues of Belayat and the subtle theory of Prophethood. experienced He obtained all the blessings of the past saints.\nIt is mentioned in the Government Gazette of India published in 1923 AD. Later, Feroze Shah Tughlaq III, the emperor of Delhi, built this city under the orders of his peer Syed Jalaluddin Bukhari. When the erstwhile Shamana district was split into a new district, Sirhind became the capital of the new district in 1961 AD. Firoz Shah dug a canal from the river Shatdru along the side of the city which greatly increased the city's importance and made it an important defensive fort for the kings of Delhi. The importance of this city is also known in a letter of Hazrat Mujaddid (RA) written to Sadr Jahan. He then requested Sadre Jahan to immediately send a carer to this city.\nHazrat Mujaddid-i-Alay-i-Sani (RA) described Sirhind Sharif in his Maktubat Sharif as second only to Makkah and Madinah. Near Sirhind Sharif there is a place called 'Baras'. This place is located on the top of the hill. Once Shaykh Imam Rabbani Mujaddid-e-Alya-e-Sani (R.A.) climbed the top of that mountain while travelling. It was time for Zuhr prayer. He used to spend a long time in the Murakaba after performing Zuhr prayer there. After Murakaba he addressed the Companions and said: I found out with the help of infidels that there are 50 Prophet's shrines on the top of this mountain. They were sent at different times for the guidance of the Hindu society. So Sirhind Sharif is not only glorified for being the birthplace of Hazrat Mujaddid-e-Alfe e-Sani (RA). In addition, he holds the body of 50 Prophets in his bosom.\nLater, King Shah Jahan built a beautiful palace and garden at Sirhind Sharif in 1044 AH. He was a disciple and a special devotee of Hazrat Mujaddid (RA) and his sons. Therefore, Sirhind Sharif is today a place of pilgrimage for millions of Muslims worldwide and an ideal and blessed place.\n- Compiled by\nMamzzad Ahmed Choudhury\n@Babu Choudhury, Assam.",

                    "review_text": "SIRHIND SHARIF, PUNJAB, INDIA.\n(Rauza Sharif)\n\nShaikh Ahmad al-Faruqi al-Sirhindi Dargah (popularly known as Mujaddid, Alf-Sani),  is situated on the Sirhind-Bassi Pathana Road at a small distance to the north of Gurdwara Fatehgarh Sahib. Sheikh Ahmed Farooqi lived at this place during the times of Akbar and Jahangir from 1563 to 1624.\nThe religious importance of Sirhind is high because it is a famous pilgrimage site for Sikhs and Muslims. Here is the famous Gurdwara Fatehgarh Sahib of Sikhs.\nHazrat Mujaddid-i-Alam-i-Sani (RA) was born in a place called 'Sirhind' in Fatehgarh Tehsil of East Punjab. This place is located in the northwest corner of India and on the eastern border of Pakistan. At that time this place was covered with deep forest. The word 'Sirhind' is a corruption of 'Seherbind'. In Hindi the word 'seher' means lion, and 'rind' means - lion forest or lion habitat or lion habitat forest. In later times, lion-men like Hazrat Shaykh Imam Rabbani Mujaddid-e Alf-e-Sani (R.A.) were born here, which proved the validity of naming this place. Needless to say, this place is located midway between Delhi and Lahore.\nHistorian Maulana Muhammad Abdul Halim Sahib in one of his books 'Mujaddide Azam' mentioned: \"Once during the reign of Feroze Shah Tughlaq, a dozen royal servants were going from Lahore to Delhi with government funds. Among them was an old man with clairvoyance. When they reached the forest called 'Sirhind' on their way, the old man knew by his spiritual power that in the near future that place would be enriched by the feet of a great man. Later that elder discussed the matter with Hazrat Syed Jalaluddin Bukhari aka Makhdum Jahania, a murshid of Firoz Shah. He was particularly moved on hearing this incident and informed the king. That, since the year 760 A.H., there has been a continuous revelation in our Tariqah that a thousand years after the time of the Prophet (PBUH), an old man will be born in Hindustan, who will be the Imam and Mujaddid of this age, and full of the virtues of Belayat and the subtle theory of Prophethood. experienced He obtained all the blessings of the past saints.\nIt is mentioned in the Government Gazette of India published in 1923 AD. Later, Feroze Shah Tughlaq III, the emperor of Delhi, built this city under the orders of his peer Syed Jalaluddin Bukhari. When the erstwhile Shamana district was split into a new district, Sirhind became the capital of the new district in 1961 AD. Firoz Shah dug a canal from the river Shatdru along the side of the city which greatly increased the city's importance and made it an important defensive fort for the kings of Delhi. The importance of this city is also known in a letter of Hazrat Mujaddid (RA) written to Sadr Jahan. He then requested Sadre Jahan to immediately send a carer to this city.\nHazrat Mujaddid-i-Alay-i-Sani (RA) described Sirhind Sharif in his Maktubat Sharif as second only to Makkah and Madinah. Near Sirhind Sharif there is a place called 'Baras'. This place is located on the top of the hill.
