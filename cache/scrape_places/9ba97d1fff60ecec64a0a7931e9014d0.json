A madarsa is also run in the mosque premises and around 50 students receive education and become hafiz and maulana.  Very good space for parking and wuzu water and space is beautiful with fishes in the area.  RO water for drinking is provided and chilled in summer.  ACs are installed for chilling environment in summer.  In jumma, little shops like in fair come serving chicken biryani, bakery product,books,caps, toys ,ballons, ice creams, fruits, etc and even  trampolin for kids to play. Great experience whenever I visit. ",
