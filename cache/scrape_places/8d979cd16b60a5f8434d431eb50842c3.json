He used to weigh the meat with a sacred stone (batia) of Lord Shankar. This stone, it is said, used to change its own weight according to the weight of the meat -- whether a ser or a maund -- required by the customer. Once some saints passing that way saw this sacred stone being used by a butcher, and they stole it. But in the night the Lord appeared in the dream of these saints, and told them that \"This butcher is my devotee, return him the stone.\" The saints did as they were told.\n\nA big fair is held at the shrine of the Baba every year from March 31 to April 2, and people from all religions and faiths congregate here. This site is a symbol of religious harmony in the region.\n\nThe shrine of Baba Sadanshah is also known by its nine steps and 32 pillars.

The Baba thought that he too would have played cymbals if he had his hands.\n\nAnd his severed hands reappeared.\nThe Baba had a divine realization that \"The woman was a cow in the previous birth, who was running away from the butcher, but you had stopped it and it was later killed by the butcher.
