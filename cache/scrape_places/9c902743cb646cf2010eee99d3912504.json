Hindu's call the river bank as Ghaat which might be it's name and called Ghata with passage of time.\nIt must have looked beautiful from other side of Yamuna probably reminding the beauty of Taj Mahal as seen from Mehtab Bagh on the other side of Yamuna river in Agra.\nPeepal trees are growing on various parts of the Masjid which with time will damage the structure if remains unchecked.\nThe grave of Zeenat-Un-Nisa lies in a corner of the same campus and remains undisclosed like her name which has also lost from the people's memories.",

The mosque is believed to be inspired by Jama Masjid in Chandni Chowk, built by her illustrious and much loved grandfather, Shah Jahan. Though much smaller in scale, and barely ever visited by travellers to the city, the mosque still stands on it's own - looking glorious, despite obvious signs of decay.\n\nZeenat-ul ghata Masjid old delhi\nThe sun setting behind the mosque\n\nZeenat-ul ghata Masjid old delhi\nInside the mosque\n\nThe mosque is located at Shahjahanabad in Daryaganj, which used to be the heart of the old Mughal capital. Now here's an interesting anecdote about the locality itself - Daryaganj was originally designed to be a market next to the river Yamuna, the lifeline of Delhi. However, once the British took control of Delhi they made several changes, including rerouting of the river. Unfortunately with this change in the course of river (darya), the market was no longer next to the river, though the name continued to be used.\n\nI digress, as I always do when I tell tales from the past. Well, let's try and answer why it's called Ghata Masjid. There are actually two theories around it. The first one is about it's tall minarets which reach the clouds or ghata (not literally, of course), and the second story is about the banks of river Yamuna with it's ghat (steps leading to the river). Maybe there is another story too, but it doesn't really matter - the name has stuck, even though some people call it ghaata (loss) masjid too.\n\nThe mosque saw some dark times during India's first independence struggle in 1857 when the Mughal rulers in Delhi joined the revolt against the British. Unfortunately, the war was lost and with that the Mughal empire in India came to an end. Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal, was exiled to Rangoon (Burma or Myanmar used to be a part of British India then) and large parts of Delhi were completely destroyed, including almost everything inside the Red Fort. The mosque wasn't razed to the ground, but the British decided to convert it into a bakery.

Here's the interesting bit - the mosque built by her was a miniature version of Jama Masjid in Delhi, while Bibi ka Maqbara is a miniature version of Taj Mahal in Agra. What's even more interesting is the fact that both were built by Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb's father, who was thrown off from his throne by Aurangzeb himself and leter imprisoned till death in Agra's Red Fort.\n\nSuch are the fascinating tales from the Mughal era.

It was constructed by more than 5000 workers. It was originally called Masjid-i-Jahan Numa, meaning 'mosque commanding view of the world'. The construction was done under the supervision of Saadullah Khan, wazir (or prime minister) during Shah Jahan's reign. The cost of the construction at the time was one million Rupees.[1] Shah Jahan also built the Taj Mahal, at Agra and the Red Fortin New Delhi, which stands opposite the Jama Masjid.\n\nThe Jama Masjid was completed in 1656 AD (1066 AH).[1] The mosque was inaugurated by an Imam Bukhari, a mullah from Bukhara, Uzbekistan, on 23 July 1656, on the invitation from Shah Jahan.[2]About 25,000 people can pray in the courtyard at a time .[3][4] The mosque is commonly called \"Jama\" which means Friday.[1]\n\nAfter the British victory in the Revolt of 1857, they confiscated the mosque and stationed their soldiers there. They also wanted to destroy the mosque as an act of punishment to the city.

The mosque is one of the best places to visit in Delhi for anyone who loves history, art, or spirituality. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to experience the grace and glory of Mahadi Masjid Delhi.I was impressed by its architecture and history. The mosque is situated in the Archaeological Survey Park, about 500 meters south of Tomb and Mosque of Maulana Jamali Kamali. The mosque bears a strong resemblance with the Bara Gumbad Masjid of Lodi period. The mosque has a unique characteristic of an open wall mosque as well as a covered mosque. The flat roofed chambers of the mosque have been adorned with coloured tiles. The roofs have been adorned with arched openings. There are three central bays on the walls of the mosque. The courtyard has been well enclosed with strong walls and has turrets in each corner. The mosque thus looks like a miniature fortress.",

Most notable is the dome that looks a shoddy work done by low-skilled masons in a hurry to give it a look different.\n\nThe Masjid is in tiptop condition right from the entrance and the ASI also has posted a full-time security guard who shared little of the thing-or-two he knows about the monument. After climbing the stairs and a majestic entrance as seen in the photo above there is a vast empty space and a wall at the end. There is also a nicely constructed well which is covered properly for safety.\n\nThe Masjid is tucked away in the woods and there is only a narrow road in a good condition that goes to the Mehrauli town. As a result the Masjid premises are peaceful and silent as almost no one visits this little monument on weekdays. Mehrauli in turn is a corrupt word for Mihiravali meaning the residence of Varah Mihir a 10th century Indian Astronomer who lived in this area.\n\n Accessibility Features:\nNo=Ramp access.\nNo=A wheelchair-accessible Entrance.\nYes=A wheelchair-accessible Restroom/Toilet.\nNo=A wheelchair-accessible Seating.\nYes=A wheelchair-accessible Parking.",
