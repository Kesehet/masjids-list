After being told the prices of the cloths and after the volunteer haggling WITH US down to 1000rs., we swiftly left.\n\nWhat a shame that these places have been inundated with scam artists to try and take advantage of none-the-wiser westerners.

Constructed by Mughal Emperor Akbar, it is one of the largest mosques in India. It is the most sought after pilgrimage site by the devotees. It is also one of the most visited tourist destinations in Agra district. Some of the designs of the mosque reflect beautiful Iranian architecture.\nAkbar commissioned the Jama Masjid as part of his new capital city of Fatehpur Sikri. The structure was one of the first sites constructed in the city, and was completed sometime between 1571 and 1574, according to its own inscriptions. The mosque was in honour of the Sufi Shaikh Salim Chishti, Akbar's spiritual advisor. It was also meant to serve as a khanqah (monastic school) for the Shaikh's descendants. In its time, it was extolled by various authors and travellers for its beauty and grandeur.\n\nThe mosque played a part in Akbar's religious designs. In 1579, he delivered the khutbah for a congregational prayer attended by the inhabitants of Fatehpur Sikri. While some of his ancestors had done this, the reading of the khutbah was typically reserved for religious leaders (such as an imam) and hence was perceived by the ulema as radical. Akbar also joined the population in their prayer, and was even seen sweeping the floors of the mosque. Kavuri-Bauer argues that all these actions were conscious moves on Akbar's part, using the mosque to portray himself as a divine sovereign rather than a regular ruler.\n\nThe Jama Masjid at Fatehpur Sikri remained a \"symbol of Mughal heritage and pride\" after Akbar's rule. The mosque was heavily admired by Akbar's son and successor Jahangir, who called it one of his father's greatest architectural achievements. Jahangir discussed the mosque complex at length with his son Khurram during a stay at Fatehpur Sikri in 1619.Khurram went on to become Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, and cited this mosque as the model for his own Jama Masjid at Delhi.",

They guys are looting. You got many people around you when you reached and everyone is calling you for guide.\nThe most hilarious thing is that they are not allowed in the Fatehpur Sikri main campus . So if you really want to go there then directly go to the Fatehpur sikri and on don't book a guide",
