The construction was done under the supervision of Saadullah Khan, wazir (or prime minister) during Shah Jahan's reign. The cost of the construction at the time was one million Rupees.[1] Shah Jahan also built the Taj Mahal, at Agra and the Red Fortin New Delhi, which stands opposite the Jama Masjid.\n\nThe Jama Masjid was completed in 1656 AD (1066 AH).[1] The mosque was inaugurated by an Imam Bukhari, a mullah from Bukhara, Uzbekistan, on 23 July 1656, on the invitation from Shah Jahan.[2]About 25,000 people can pray in the courtyard at a time .[3][4] The mosque is commonly called \"Jama\" which means Friday.[1]\n\nAfter the British victory in the Revolt of 1857, they confiscated the mosque and stationed their soldiers there. They also wanted to destroy the mosque as an act of punishment to the city. But due to opposition faced, the demolition was not done.[5]\n\nThe iconic mosque is one of the last monuments built under Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. After the construction of the monument in 1656, it remained the royal mosque of the emperors until the end of the Mughal period.\n\nDuring 1948, the last Nizam of Hyderabad, Asaf Jah VII was asked for a donation of Rs75,000 to repair one-fourth of the mosque floor.

The mosque's stunning design, adorned with intricate carvings and delicate patterns, is a testament to the rich Mughal heritage that Delhi proudly holds. The sense of serenity and spirituality that envelops the mosque's courtyard is truly captivating, providing visitors with a tranquil oasis amidst the bustling city.\nUpon stepping outside the masjid, I found myself immersed in the bustling atmosphere of the spice and dry fruit market. It was an absolute feast for the senses. The air was infused with the tantalizing scents of various spices, creating an intoxicating symphony that enticed every passerby. The market's vibrant display of colors was a visual treat, with a mesmerizing array of spices and an assortment of dried fruits, all meticulously arranged in shops that lined the streets.\nWandering through the market, I encountered a treasure trove of culinary delights. The spice market boasted an extensive selection of spices, ranging from the familiar favorites like cumin, turmeric, and cardamom to the more exotic and lesser-known varieties. The shopkeepers were friendly and knowledgeable, eagerly sharing their expertise and recommendations for the perfect blend of flavors.\nAs I ventured deeper into the market, I discovered a cornucopia of dried fruits. From succulent dates and figs to mouthwatering apricots and raisins, the market offered an impressive range of choices. The fruits, meticulously arranged and preserved, presented a visual feast that reflected the dedication and craftsmanship of the local vendors.\n\nWhat truly impressed me about this market was the vibrant atmosphere created by the bustling activity and the friendly interactions with the locals. The constant chatter, bargaining, and exchange of culinary tips added a lively energy to the surroundings, making it an unforgettable cultural experience.\nVisiting the Fatehpuri Masjid and the adjacent spice and dry fruit market is an absolute must for anyone with a love for history, architecture, and the culinary arts. It offers a harmonious blend of the sacred and the sensory, allowing visitors to appreciate the rich heritage of Delhi while immersing themselves in a cornucopia of flavors.\nOverall, my visit to Fatehpuri Masjid and the biggest spice and dry fruit market of Delhi was nothing short of delightful.

Flanked by towering minarets, the mosque has a traditional design with the prayer hall having seven-arched openings. Among the seven arches, the central arch is the highest.\nMasjid Fatehpuri has three gates: one is right in front of the Red Fort at Chandni Chowk and the other two are in the north and the south. Id-ul-Fitr and Id-ul-Azha is celebrated in a grand way in the Fatehpuri Masjid, Delhi. The place is on the heart of the city (Chandni Chowk) so it can be reached very easily.
