There is disagreement as to when the Kakrail Mosque was first built and by whom.

The western wall of the mosque is wavy. The mosque also has wide balconies on three sides. There are two small pond-like houses for ablutions on the south and north sides. Hundreds of people can perform ablution together on the four sides of this pond. Outside the mosque there is also a toilet. A little away from the mosque on the north side there is a two-storied building for ablutions and bathrooms.\nBasically the main part of the mosque has three floors. The part on the right side is six stories. The six-storey building is used for Heafzkhana, dormitory and Tabligh office.\n\nAlthough the external structure of this mosque is beautiful, there is no splendor inside. The biggest difference of this mosque is that it has no door. It is open day and night for all. This mosque is different from other mosques for many reasons.
