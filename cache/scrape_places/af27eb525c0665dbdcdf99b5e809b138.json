                    "review_text": "Moti Masjid is a white marble mosque inside the Red Fort complex in Delhi, India. Located to the west of the Hammam and close to the Diwan-i-Khas, it was built by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb from 1659-1660. The mosque was built for his 2nd wife Nawab Bai. The mosque was also used by the ladies of the Zenana. The mosque was constructed at a cost of Rs. 160,000.\nThe prayer hall has three arches, and it is divided into two aisles. It is surmounted with three bulbous domes, which were originally covered in gilded copper. The gilded copper was probably lost after the Indian rebellion of 1857.\nThe outer walls are oriented in symmetry with the outer walls of the fort, while the inner walls are at a slightly different orientation to align with the location of Mecca. The eastern door is provided with copper-plated leaves.\nThe mosque is plastered in white on the outside. Inside is the white marble courtyard and a prayer hall, which stands on a higher level than the courtyard. The floor of the prayer-hall is inlaid with outlines of small carpets for prayers (musalla) in black marble. In the middle of the courtyard is a small, square ablution fountain. The courtyard measures 40 x 35 feet.\nAnother small mosque by the same name was built for private prayer by Aurangzeb's son, the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah I (r. 1707-1712), close to the Ajmeri Gate of the Dargah of Sufi saint Qutbuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki R.H, which is located in Mehrauli at the Jahaz Mahal. It is an imitation of the one inside the Red Fort.",
