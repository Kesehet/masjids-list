As Amer, it was also the capital of the ancient princely state known as Jaipur. The city was founded in 1728 by Maharaja Jai   Singh II of Amer. Jaipur is famous for its rich building tradition, interesting culture and historical importance. The city is surrounded by the Aravalli mountain range on three sides. Jaipur city is identified by the pink Dholpuri stones used in its palaces and old houses, which is the specialty of the architecture here. In 1876, the then Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh had the entire city covered in pink color to welcome Prince Albert of Wales, Queen Elizabeth of England. Since then the city has been named Pink City. According to the 2011 census, Jaipur is the tenth most populous city in India. This city was named Jaipur after the name of King Jai Singh II. Jaipur is also part of India's tourist circuit, the Golden Triangle. Delhi, Agra and Jaipur come in this Golden Triangle. When we look at their position in the map of India, it takes the shape of a triangle. For this reason it is called the Golden Triangle of India. The distance from India's capital Delhi to Jaipur is 280 kilometers. wikipedia",

It has a rectangular prayer hall which has beautiful facade made by seven arches. There are three small gates in three different directions that take you to the courtyard in front of the mosque, the place where all devotees pray. It has ablution tank and the corners have been ornamented by minar type kiosks.",
