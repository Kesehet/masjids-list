Constructed in the early 14th century by a wealthy Muslim merchant from the region, this historic mosque holds a significant place in the area's culture, architecture, and vibrant economy, thanks to the contributions of the Muslim population over the centuries.\n\nThe mosque faced adversity during the arrival of the Portuguese in India, as they attempted to burn it down. While it suffered partial damage, the mosque underwent renovation under the Zamorin's patronage. The original five-storey structure was transformed into a four-storeyed one, and in 1578-79, it proudly reopened its doors.\n\nIn keeping with the architectural style of Muslim structures in Kerala during that era, Mishkal Mosque forgoes domes and minarets. Instead, it embraces the use of timber, laterite, and sloping tiled roofs, creating a distinctive and elegant appearance.",

Constructed in the early 14th century by a wealthy Muslim merchant from the region, this historic mosque holds a significant place in the area's culture, architecture, and vibrant economy, thanks to the contributions of the Muslim population over the centuries.\n\nThe mosque faced adversity during the arrival of the Portuguese in India, as they attempted to burn it down. While it suffered partial damage, the mosque underwent renovation under the Zamorin's patronage. The original five-storey structure was transformed into a four-storeyed one, and in 1578-79, it proudly reopened its doors.\n\nIn keeping with the architectural style of Muslim structures in Kerala during that era, Mishkal Mosque forgoes domes and minarets. Instead, it embraces the use of timber, laterite, and sloping tiled roofs, creating a distinctive and elegant appearance.",

In those days, people did not have clocks and only the sound of bells used to inform them about the time. People of Ludhiana might not know that it took 44 years to build this clock tower near the railway station. When the clock tower was built, it used to be the tallest building in the city and the clock tower was visible from every corner of the city. Ludhiana, [Rajesh Bhatt]. The British built bell towers in every city in memory of their Queen Victoria. The British built bell towers at the busiest places of the cities so that people could always remember their queen. At that time, the technology was not so advanced for the construction of multi-storey buildings, so it took a long time to build a tall building like Ghantaghar. The Victoria Memorial Clock Tower of Ludhiana was inaugurated on October 18, 1906 by Sir Charles Montgomery, the then Lieutenant Governor of Punjab State, Ludhiana. Had done with the then Deputy Commissioner Dewan Tek Chand. The mechanism inside the tower is known as the Turret Clock.
