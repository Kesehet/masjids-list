The teachings and normative example of Muhammad, called the sunnah, documented in accounts called the hadith, provide a constitutional model for Muslims.[19] Islam teaches of a \"Final Judgement\" wherein the righteous will be rewarded in paradise (jannah) and the unrighteous will be punished in hell (jahannam).[20] The Five Pillars--considered obligatory acts of worship--comprise the Islamic oath and creed (shahada); daily prayers (salah); almsgiving (zakat); fasting (sawm) in the month of Ramadan; and a mandated pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca.[21] Islamic law, sharia, touches on virtually every aspect of life, from banking and finance and welfare to women's roles and the environment.[22][23] Prominent religious festivals include Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha. The three holiest sites in Islam in descending order are Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina, and Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.[24]",

                    "review_text": "Islam teaches that God is one and incomparable.[14] Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times through earlier prophets such as Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, among others;[15][16] these earlier revelations are attributed to Judaism and Christianity, which are regarded in Islam as spiritual predecessor faiths.[17] Muslims consider the Quran to be the verbatim word of God and the unaltered, final revelation.[18] They also consider Muhammad as the main and final Islamic prophet. The teachings and normative example of Muhammad, called the sunnah, documented in accounts called the hadith, provide a constitutional model for Muslims.[19] Islam teaches of a \"Final Judgement\" wherein the righteous will be rewarded in paradise (jannah) and the unrighteous will be punished in hell (jahannam).[20] The Five Pillars--considered obligatory acts of worship--comprise the Islamic oath and creed (shahada); daily prayers (salah); almsgiving (zakat); fasting (sawm) in the month of Ramadan; and a mandated pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca.[21] Islamic law, sharia, touches on virtually every aspect of life, from banking and finance and welfare to women's roles and the environment.[22][23] Prominent religious festivals include Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha. The three holiest sites in Islam in descending order are Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina, and Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.[24]",
