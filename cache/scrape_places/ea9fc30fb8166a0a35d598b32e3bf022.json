The mosque is believed to be inspired by Jama Masjid in Chandni Chowk, built by her illustrious and much loved grandfather, Shah Jahan. Though much smaller in scale, and barely ever visited by travellers to the city, the mosque still stands on it's own - looking glorious, despite obvious signs of decay.\n\nZeenat-ul ghata Masjid old delhi\nThe sun setting behind the mosque\n\nZeenat-ul ghata Masjid old delhi\nInside the mosque\n\nThe mosque is located at Shahjahanabad in Daryaganj, which used to be the heart of the old Mughal capital. Now here's an interesting anecdote about the locality itself - Daryaganj was originally designed to be a market next to the river Yamuna, the lifeline of Delhi. However, once the British took control of Delhi they made several changes, including rerouting of the river. Unfortunately with this change in the course of river (darya), the market was no longer next to the river, though the name continued to be used.\n\nI digress, as I always do when I tell tales from the past. Well, let's try and answer why it's called Ghata Masjid. There are actually two theories around it. The first one is about it's tall minarets which reach the clouds or ghata (not literally, of course), and the second story is about the banks of river Yamuna with it's ghat (steps leading to the river). Maybe there is another story too, but it doesn't really matter - the name has stuck, even though some people call it ghaata (loss) masjid too.\n\nThe mosque saw some dark times during India's first independence struggle in 1857 when the Mughal rulers in Delhi joined the revolt against the British. Unfortunately, the war was lost and with that the Mughal empire in India came to an end. Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal, was exiled to Rangoon (Burma or Myanmar used to be a part of British India then) and large parts of Delhi were completely destroyed, including almost everything inside the Red Fort. The mosque wasn't razed to the ground, but the British decided to convert it into a bakery.

Here's the interesting bit - the mosque built by her was a miniature version of Jama Masjid in Delhi, while Bibi ka Maqbara is a miniature version of Taj Mahal in Agra. What's even more interesting is the fact that both were built by Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb's father, who was thrown off from his throne by Aurangzeb himself and leter imprisoned till death in Agra's Red Fort.\n\nSuch are the fascinating tales from the Mughal era.

The construction was done under the supervision of Saadullah Khan, wazir (or prime minister) during Shah Jahan's reign. The cost of the construction at the time was one million Rupees.[1] Shah Jahan also built the Taj Mahal, at Agra and the Red Fortin New Delhi, which stands opposite the Jama Masjid.\n\nThe Jama Masjid was completed in 1656 AD (1066 AH).[1] The mosque was inaugurated by an Imam Bukhari, a mullah from Bukhara, Uzbekistan, on 23 July 1656, on the invitation from Shah Jahan.[2]About 25,000 people can pray in the courtyard at a time .[3][4] The mosque is commonly called \"Jama\" which means Friday.[1]\n\nAfter the British victory in the Revolt of 1857, they confiscated the mosque and stationed their soldiers there. They also wanted to destroy the mosque as an act of punishment to the city. But due to opposition faced, the demolition was not done.[5]\n\nThe iconic mosque is one of the last monuments built under Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. After the construction of the monument in 1656, it remained the royal mosque of the emperors until the end of the Mughal period.\n\nDuring 1948, the last Nizam of Hyderabad, Asaf Jah VII was asked for a donation of Rs75,000 to repair one-fourth of the mosque floor.
