There, he was beheaded (Guillotined) and his body cut into four pieces(quartered).These body parts were displayed in the beaches of Bardez and Panjim in Goa. His severed head was pickled in saline and send to Kannur to be displayed inorder to strike terror among the local population. Thus there is no proper qabar for Kunhali IV",
