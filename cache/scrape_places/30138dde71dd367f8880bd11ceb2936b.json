                    "review_translated_text": "This is Baghdad. Not the Baghdad of the Arabic stories my mother told me. Baghdad in God's own country. It is only nine kilometers from Kannur city. Yes, the village of Baileel in Kannur, the land of the sheikhs, is also nicknamed the Baghdad of India. This is also the resting place of the rarest migratory parrots in Kerala. The 457th Uruz Mubarak of Shaikh Khausul Aslam Shaikh Abdul Qadir Sani, who rested here, is being held on Friday and Saturday. Many people from inside and outside Kerala will come to the shrine to refresh his memory\n\nFrom Yama to Chirakal...\nThe history of Sheikh Abdul Qadir Sani begins with Sheikh Uthman, a descendant of Abu Bakr Siddiq, the first disciple of the Prophet Muhammad and the first Caliph. Osman was the Sultan of Hamadan in Yemen. 450 years ago he left everything from the palace of Hamadan and came to Valapattanam in Kerala. He was given a warm welcome at Chirakkal Palace. Meanwhile he had a divine vision. That your base is here and that you marry and live here. So he married the daughter of Valapatnam Khasi. Soon Abdulqadir Sani was born.\n\nShaikh Abdul Qadir Sani and Bhaileel..\n\nThe history of this place is clarified in the Baheel Maulud book prepared by Abdul Aziz Maulavi, one of the Makhdums of Ponnani. Abdul Qadir Sani had many miracles in his childhood and was invited and given a great position in the Chirakkal palace. On the day of her 15th birthday, Suhra Vardi met Sheikh Mahmudul Qabushani, a famous sheikh and scholar of Tawreeq. With that, Abdulqadir Sani opened the door to the spiritual path. Lord Chirakal prepared all the facilities but left them all and found a place outside without any noise of the princely kingdom. History says that this is how the name Baheel came about.\n\nBaghdad, India\n\nAbdul Qadir Sani came to mean Abdul Qadir II who came after Sultanul Auliya Abdul Qadir Jilani from Baghdad. Zani means second. That's how Bagheel got its name as Bagdad in India. Near the big maqam, more than 40 auliyas who were disciples of Abdul Qadir Sani and more than 40 sheikhs are resting in small maqams.\n\nFeatures of the release\n\nThe life of the Mahanavars who lived 453 years ago was exemplary. It is known as the Walaif of Baheel Shaikh. It still exists today. Short fixed surahs in prayers, special prayer before Subh prayer, Aurad and congregational prayer in the inner mosque after Subh until sunrise. Asr prayer and Aurad, Dhikr halqa after Maghrib on Thursday, Friday and Monday nights, Taraweeh prayer at 1 o'clock after midnight in Ramadan, and Tauba after Jumuah prayer are unique here. Khatmul Qur'an Uruz is held here on the 16th of the Arabic month of Dulqaad. By Sheikh Abdul Qadir Sani. Baheel Shaikh is the descendants of his daughter known as family. At each time one of the family is appointed as Shaykh for life as stipulated in the family's record. Maniyur Ahmed Muslyar is currently in the position of Shaikh.",
