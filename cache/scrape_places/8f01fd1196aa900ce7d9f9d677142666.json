How will this be settled in the end?\nThe master thought for a while, then got up from his seat and distributed some money among all the disciples, he gave 100 dirhams to the second boy, 75 to the third, 60 to the fourth, 50 to the fifth, 25 to the sixth, 10 to the sixth and 5 to the seventh, and the boy who asked the question Gave him only one dirham.\n\nThe boy was very sad and sad on this division of Ustad, he was feeling insulted that why did Ustad consider him the lowest and the least worthy...??\n\nThe teacher smilingly looked at everyone and said: Holiday to all the boys, all of you go and spend this money completely, now we will meet on a weekday at the township's baker's tandoor.\n\nOn the weekday, all the students reached the baker's oven, where the teacher was already waiting for everyone present.\nAfter all the boys had come, the teacher told them that each one of you would climb this tandoor and give me an account of where you have spent your money.\n\nAfter putting the first boy, who had received one hundred dirhams, on the hood of the burning oven, the master asked: Tell me, how did you spend the hundred dirhams given by me..?\n\nTroubled by the heat of the flames coming out of the burning oven and the heat of the hot munder, the boy kept one leg and raised the other....\nRemembers the money spent and tells that he had taken ice cream for five dirhams, ten tea for breakfast, ten grapes, five dirham breads and so on for the rest of the expenses. ...\nThe boy's feet were burning with heat, while the rest of the body was burning with the flames coming out of the oven, he was thirsty in such a short time, and the words also started faltering. He got down after giving the account with difficulty, after that the second boy then the third and then the rest of the boys like this......\nEven the turn of the boy who had got one dirham came.\n\nUstad also told him that you also climb the oven and give your account. The boy quickly climbed the oven, said without hesitation that he had bought a bunch of coriander for the house for one dirham, and at the same time, smiling, got down and stood in front of the oven, while the rest of the boys were still sitting motionless on their feet. But they were cooling it by pouring water on it.\n\nThe master, after explaining to all the boys, specially telling that boy, said: Children! This was a small scene of the Book, according to the Day of Judgment, every person will be accounted for according to the amount he was given.\n\nThe boy looked at the teacher with love and said that I am jealous of the little you have given me and I love your gift, but the example of Allah Tabarak and Taala is very high and high.\n\nMay Allah Ta'ala save us from the intensity of his calculations and make us enter Jannah without accounting by saying a matter of forgiveness and forgiveness with us. Amen",
