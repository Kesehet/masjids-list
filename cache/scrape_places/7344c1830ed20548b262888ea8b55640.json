A drinking water facility is available, which is particularly beneficial during hot summer months. The bathroom facilities are relatively good and maintained properly. The mosque also has ample ablution space, making it easy for worshippers to perform their ablution before prayer.\n\nThe current imam of the mosque, Saleem Darimi, is a good personality who leads the prayers with great passion and dedication. His sermons are inspiring and motivate worshippers to become better individuals.\n\nOverall, \"The Mosque Sidheeq\" is an excellent mosque, providing great facilities for its worshippers.
