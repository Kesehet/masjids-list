The mosque has a very calming environment and is a perfect place for offering prayers and seeking solace.\n\nOne of the best things about Masjid-e-Sahaba is the youth-oriented sermons that are delivered by the imams. They are knowledgeable and well-versed in Islamic teachings and are always ready to guide the younger generation towards the right path. The sermons are delivered in Urdu and are easy to understand, making them accessible to everyone.\n\nThe mosque was built by Late Gulam Shabbir sahab, who was a prominent businessman and philanthropist. His vision was to create a space that would not only serve as a place of worship but also as a center for community development. He believed that the mosque could become a hub of learning and a platform for social change.\n\nMasjid-e-Sahaba has several facilities for the community, including a library. The mosque also hosts regular seminars, workshops, and lectures on various topics related to Islam, as well as social issues that affect the community.\n\nIn addition to its spiritual significance, Masjid-e-Sahaba is also a stunning architectural masterpiece. The mosque has a magnificent facade with intricate designs and carvings. The interior is equally impressive, with spacious prayer halls that can accommodate a large number of worshippers.\n\nOverall, Masjid-e-Sahaba is a must-visit for anyone looking to connect with their faith or seeking a peaceful place to pray. It offers a unique blend of tradition and modernity and is a testament to the vision of Late Gulam Shabbir sahab.",
