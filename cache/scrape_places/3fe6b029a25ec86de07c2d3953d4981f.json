They did not succeed for a long time, then in the eighties they took advantage of the political vacuum in India and took part in politics and succeeded to some extent.\n\nThese people fed the minds of the Hindus that if the Muslims became powerful, then the existence of the Hindus was in danger. Singh Vajpayee etc. These people proved themselves as the Messiah of Hinduism and that is why these people got good votes in the elections.\n\nThese people declared all the other major Hindu political parties of India to be pro-Muslim and this was accepted by the people, while there was no such thing. There were anti-Muslim leaders in the other parties too, but these extremists made themselves all. He proved to be the biggest anti-Muslim and the biggest protector of Hindus. The incident of Babri Masjid happened, but he had to do countless other incidents to prove his theory.\n\nThen there was an uproar all over the world over what happened in Gujarat. America had decided not to give an American visa to the Chief Minister of Gujarat. removed all entry restrictions) but after that these people caught such a wave from here that there is no counter to this wave that day and today their government not only in Gujarat but also in many other states. It became stable because these people have made every political opponent of theirs a supporter of Muslims and made the competition twenty and eighty.\n\nIn the riots that are happening even today, they themselves and the entire Indian media are seeing their political opponents as Muslim supporters and are proving the armed Hindus as oppressed before the 2024 general elections. JP's condition is bad, they will try to compete with twenty and eighty by making such riots in any case so that they win the next elections as well.\n\nAfter these people came to power, thousands of Muslims were killed in riots. The government not only praises the killers of Muslims, but also makes them mayors or members of the assembly. They are also given big awards. People have kindled a fire in India for the sake of their power which will one day turn into flames and consume the whole of India. Looks ready.\n\n#Sati",
