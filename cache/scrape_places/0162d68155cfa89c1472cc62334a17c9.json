Better avoid during monsoons as the place infamous for landslides. There is no place for not more than 10 cars as you can see the pictures attached. One can enjoy a nice walk from the starting point as soon as you take the turn or just trust your instincts and find a tight parking spot. It's barely 700 m walk or trek however you say it. The temple is surrounded by two large meadows on either side where you can sit/meditate/relax. Along with the temple there's a small house where the priest stays. It's a 1-2 hr affair but a place worth visiting.",
