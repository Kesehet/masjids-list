After getting down from metro station it is a walking distance and you don't have to hire rickshaw or uber. Walk is not more than 6-7 min.\n\nIf you are coming by your own vehicle then there is parking space available.\n\nI tried to find how old is the mosque but not able to but by looking at design of mosque and entrance and other areas it looks like it was made before freedom so we can say its around 70 years old.\n\nYou can see the top of mosque from Metro with getting down. This is not a famous place for tourist and there is no any monument inside the premises. Only locals from nearby areas come here to pray.\n\nYou can see lightning and crowd on the festival of Eid which happens twice in a year. If you are tourist and nearby this place then there is one more famous Temple Birla Mandir which is 10-12 min walk and that is very beautiful.\n\nAlso, this area comes under NDMC and they maintain the place is very neat and clean. In the early morning you will love this area. It is beautiful to walk around here and if you want to see some greennry then there is one big park/jungle behind the mosque which is called Bhulu Bhatiyari Park. Thanks",

It gets its name from the striking red sandstone used in its construction, giving it a distinctive appearance. The fort complex is surrounded by massive walls and features impressive gates, pavilions, and beautiful gardens.\n\nLal Qila is renowned for its rich history and association with India's struggle for independence. It was here that the Indian National Flag was hoisted for the first time on August 15, 1947, marking India's independence from British colonial rule.\n\nToday, the Red Fort is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a popular tourist attraction. Every year, on India's Independence Day, the Prime Minister hoists the national flag and delivers a speech from the Red Fort's ramparts. The fort serves as a symbol of India's sovereignty and its historical legacy, making it a must-visit destination for those interested in India's history and culture.",

It gets its name from the striking red sandstone used in its construction, giving it a distinctive appearance. The fort complex is surrounded by massive walls and features impressive gates, pavilions, and beautiful gardens.\n\nLal Qila is renowned for its rich history and association with India's struggle for independence. It was here that the Indian National Flag was hoisted for the first time on August 15, 1947, marking India's independence from British colonial rule.\n\nToday, the Red Fort is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a popular tourist attraction. Every year, on India's Independence Day, the Prime Minister hoists the national flag and delivers a speech from the Red Fort's ramparts. The fort serves as a symbol of India's sovereignty and its historical legacy, making it a must-visit destination for those interested in India's history and culture.",

I went there because I wanted to try delicious food and I consider no better time than Ramzan to visit this place.\n\nAREA COVERED : ? I covered lane opposite to Gate No. 1\n\nFOOD : Since I am vegetarian I had very less option to choose and thus made sure to try all that comes under my category\n\n1) Sharbat E Mohabbat : This is the best thing and was my very reason of coming here. I thankfully get to try this. This drink is best summer drink which I think can come into all cities. This is a mixture of Roohafza, water, milk and watermelon.\n\nPrice : Rs. 70\n\n2) Shrimal : The second dish which I have tried on this lane was shrimal which has huge variety from pistachio to almond.\n\nPrice : Rs 70-100\n\n3) Kiwi and Dragon Fruit Plate : Just when you are roaming around here you will surely feel the need of keep hydrating yourself and KIWI and DRAGON FRUIT at just Rs. 10 are something which you should not afford to miss.\n\n4) Dates : Rest you will see many vendors of dates which has dry as well as packed dates.",
