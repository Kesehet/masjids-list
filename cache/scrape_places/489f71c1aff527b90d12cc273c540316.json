It is surrounded by security agents and it is a very sure place to visit. Bags are scanned, and everyone goes to a check-in ,exactly like at the airport.  The architecture is amazing,  all white everywhere.  Inside, it is  allowed for pictures and videos . It takes almost one and a half hours for a visit in peace and quiet, no rush just admire .
