                "answer": "Established by Zainuddin Makhdum, a Muslim spiritual leader in the year 1510, the Ponnani Juma Masjid is considered as the Mecca of Muslims in Kerala. The mosque is said to have been built by a Hindu artisan, in the traditional temple architectural style of Kerala.\nAn outstanding feature of the Juma Masjid, apart from being built by a Hindu, is the lamp installed here which is nearly 500 odd years old. The mosque was once an important centre of Islamic philosophy and students from across the globe would sit under this oil lamp which is still kept burning to acquire knowledge. The mosque is also known as Valiya Juma Masjid.\nCourtesy: native planet",

It was a place of tranquility, spirituality, and community.\n\nUpon entering, I was struck by the stunning architecture and intricate design of the mosque. The craftsmanship and attention to detail were evident in every corner, from the beautiful geometric patterns adorning the walls to the elegant calligraphy embellishing the prayer hall.\n\nThe atmosphere inside the mosque was serene and peaceful. The soft lighting and subdued colors created a sense of serenity, fostering a calm and reflective ambiance. The absence of unnecessary distractions allowed me to focus on my prayers and personal connection with the divine.\n\nThe mosque was well-maintained and clean, reflecting the reverence and respect given to the sacred space. The staff and volunteers were welcoming, providing guidance and assistance to visitors. They were knowledgeable about the mosque's history, traditions, and rituals, and readily answered any questions I had.\n\nDuring prayer times, the congregation came together, forming a sense of unity and community. It was heartwarming to see people from diverse backgrounds and cultures gathering in harmony, united in their faith. The imam's recitation of the Quran was melodic and heartfelt, enhancing the spiritual experience.\n\nBeyond its role as a place of worship, the mosque served as a hub for community activities and engagement. It offered educational programs, lectures, and social events that promoted learning, understanding, and social cohesion among its members. This inclusive and welcoming approach fostered a sense of belonging and support within the community.\n\nIn conclusion, the mosque I visited exemplified the essence of a sacred space. Its exquisite architecture, peaceful atmosphere, and strong sense of community made it a place of solace and inspiration. I left with a deep sense of spiritual fulfillment and a desire to return. I would highly recommend visiting this mosque to experience its beauty, serenity, and the sense of unity it embodies.",
