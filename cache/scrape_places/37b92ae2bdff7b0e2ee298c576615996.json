Gogamedi, also known as Dhurmedi, is a town in Bhadra assembly constituency of Hanumangarh district of Rajasthan. Here, on the Navami of Bhadon Krishna Paksha, a fair of God Gogaji is held. They are worshiped by both Hindus and Muslims. In Gujarat, people of Rebari caste call Gogaji by the name of Goga Maharaj.\n\nGogaji was the great disciple of Guru Gorakhnath. He was born in Vikram Samvat 1003 in a distinguished Rajput family in the village of Dadrewa (Dattkheda) in Taranagar tehsil of Churu district. But people of all religions and sects come from far and wide to pay obeisance. Kayam Khani Muslim community calls him Jahar Peer and comes to the said place to pay obeisance and make vows. In this way this place is a symbol of Hindu and Muslim unity. The medieval great man Gogaji earned the respect of Hindu, Muslim and Sikh sects and became famous as a secular folk deity called Pir. Gogaji was born on Bhado Sudi Navami with the blessing of Guru Gorakhnath from the womb of Bachhal Kanwar, wife of Jaibarji (Thakar Javersingh), the ruler of Dadrewa (Churu) Chauhan dynasty of Rajasthan. Gogaji was a brave and famous king after King Prithviraj Chauhan in the Chauhan dynasty. Gogaji's kingdom extended from Satluj to Hansi (Haryana).",
