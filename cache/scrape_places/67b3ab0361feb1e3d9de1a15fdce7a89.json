This spiritual center is not only of great significance to the local community but also serves as the hub for the global Tabligh Jamaat movement. I had the privilege of being there to offer Maghrib and Isha prayers, and the entire experience was awe-inspiring.\n\nThe sheer scale of the gathering was astounding, with nearly 2,000 people congregating within the seven-story building. What struck me immediately was the diversity of the attendees, including a substantial number of international Tabligh workers. This truly reflected the global reach and influence of the Tabligh Jamaat movement.\n\nOne aspect that deserves special mention is the remarkable organization and management of the event. The volunteers working diligently inside the Markaz demonstrated incredible skill in maintaining order, ensuring proper space management, and guiding visitors. Given the sheer number of people present, their efforts were nothing short of commendable. The volunteers' dedication and commitment to their roles were evident, and their polite and well-trained demeanor made the experience even more pleasant.\n\nCleanliness, despite the large gathering, was well-maintained, which is a testament to the meticulous planning and execution by the organizers. This added to the overall positive atmosphere and enhanced the spiritual experience for everyone present.\n\nOne of the highlights of my visit was attending a speech by a notable Islamic scholar after the Maghrib prayer. The scholar's eloquent and enlightening speech left a lasting impact on me. I later learned that such speeches are a regular feature, occurring after each of the obligatory prayers, and feature senior Islamic scholars from various parts of the world. This commitment to spiritual education and discourse was truly impressive and provided a unique opportunity for attendees to gain insights and knowledge.\n\nBeyond the spiritual experience inside the Markaz, the area surrounding it was vibrant and full of life. Nizamuddin is renowned for its quality street food and restaurants. Karim's, a famous Delhi institution known for its delectable Mughlai cuisine, is just a stone's throw away. Exploring the culinary delights of the area added another layer of richness to my visit.\n\nIn conclusion, my visit to the Nizamuddin Tabligh Markaz in Delhi was an enriching and spiritually fulfilling experience. It showcased the unity and diversity of the Tabligh Jamaat movement on a global scale. The dedication of the volunteers, the educational opportunities, the spiritual environment, and the vibrant surroundings made it a memorable visit. I left with a sense of peace, enlightenment, and a deep appreciation for the remarkable work being done by the Tabligh Jamaat community. It's an experience I will cherish and hope to revisit in the future.\n\nNB: Isha jamat pryer is at 10 pm.",

Actually i was supposed to be there years ago along with jamat. But unfortunately i couldn't. Somehow i went there yesterday at Evening and Offered Namaz e Asar in the Banglewali Masjid Alhamdulillah.\nWherever i see in the masjid i only find members of jamath from all over the world. Allapak un sab ko aur unke tufel sari ummat ko hidayat ata farmay..\nAnd Ladies those who are with jamath can only stay there otherwise there is no any facility for other women to stay or offer namaz neither in masjid nor in Hazraths Premises.",

The Kalan Masjid rises amidst a crowd of closed houses, also known as the Black Mosque or Black Mosque because the ravages of time had blackened the original coat of lime with mould.\n\nThe mosque can be entered by climbing more than two dozen slightly steep stairs, which take you to the mosque standing at a height of 20 feet from the ground.  The minarets are smaller than those of Mughal mosques, but are still impressive, as the thick walls provide strength to the mosque.\n\nApart from the main prayer area, the mosque also has apartments that probably hosted the Imam (chief cleric) in the past, although in the present day they have been converted into residential quarters for the people of the area.  While quartzite was used to construct the mosque, the decorative lattice work was originally done in red sandstone, although the panels have been covered with bricks at some point following vandalism on the monument.",

The Kalan Masjid rises amidst a crowd of closed houses, also known as the Black Mosque or Black Mosque because the ravages of time had blackened the original coat of lime with mould.\n\nThe mosque can be entered by climbing more than two dozen slightly steep stairs, which take you to the mosque standing at a height of 20 feet from the ground.  The minarets are smaller than those of Mughal mosques, but are still impressive, as the thick walls provide strength to the mosque.\n\nApart from the main prayer area, the mosque also has apartments that probably hosted the Imam (chief cleric) in the past, although in the present day they have been converted into residential quarters for the people of the area.  While quartzite was used to construct the mosque, the decorative lattice work was originally done in red sandstone, although the panels have been covered with bricks at some point following vandalism on the monument.",
