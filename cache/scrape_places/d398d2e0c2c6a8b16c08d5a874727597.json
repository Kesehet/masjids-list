One day, as she sat on the steps of her dargah, a grand procession of the King happened to pass by. Miyan Saheb's eyes met the eyes of the king. Taken by her beauty, the king ordered his guards to bring her.\nThe guards found only an elderly woman, walking with a weak stick. On further inquiry, she insisted that she was the sole proprietor of the place. Taken aback, the king decided to personally investigate the matter. He demanded an answer from the old lady. Looking straight into the king's eyes, she said, \"0 King, the youthful maiden you seek can never be possessed by you. Marriage is not destined, ownership eludes you.\"\n\nThe king pleaded to see the mysterious beauty once more. He pledged that he would never marry her. At this, the old woman underwent a miraculous transformation, revealing herself to be the gorgeous Miyan Saheb. The king had learned his lesson that some treasures are meant to be cherished in bonds and these are beyond the limits of marriage.\n\nIn today's time, no one knows the Miyan sahib or the King of the story.\n\nThursday is regarded as the most auspicious day to offer prayers at Miyan Saheb's grave. The sacred shrine becomes a vibrant meeting point for the community during Muharram and Shab-e-Baraat. On both these nights, the community sits together and shares their stories of life. On Shab-e-Baraat, the community organizes a grand langar. In it, 30 kilograms of mutton, 300 rotis, and halwa are prepared and distributed among the poor.\n\nThe architecture of the building gives the idea that it was built during the Lodhi era. A relic here also serves as a clue. Once, the eunuchs, now often marginalized, played important roles in vital positions in the royal courts.

This hidden gem in the heart of the city has a rich history and an aura that embraces you with warmth and acceptance.\n\nAs soon as I stepped foot inside the Khanqah, I was immediately drawn to the vibrant colors and intricate designs adorning the walls. The architecture itself is a masterpiece, a testament to the blend of cultures and traditions that have shaped Delhi's diverse heritage.\n\nWhat sets Hijron ka Khanqah apart from any other place I've visited is its unique purpose. It serves as a sanctuary for the Hijra community, a marginalized group that has often faced discrimination and exclusion. Here, they find solace, companionship, and a safe space to express their true selves.\n\nThe energy within the Khanqah is palpable. The Hijras, with their infectious spirit and resilience, welcomed me with open arms. Their stories, struggles, and triumphs echo through the halls, leaving you with a profound sense of empathy and admiration.\n\nThe Hijron ka Khanqah is not merely a physical structure; it's a symbol of acceptance, unity, and love. It's a place where people can learn, grow, and foster understanding. The various events and programs organized here aim to break societal stereotypes and promote inclusivity, giving a voice to those who have long been silenced.\n\nDuring my visit, I had the opportunity to participate in a storytelling session. It was a transformative experience, as I listened to narratives that challenged my preconceived notions and broadened my understanding of gender and identity. The genuine connections I made with the Hijra community and fellow visitors were invaluable, leaving an indelible mark on my heart.\n\nWhether you're a local or a traveler passing through Delhi, I urge you to seek out Hijron ka Khanqah. It's a place where compassion reigns, where barriers are broken, and where you'll find the true essence of humanity. Prepare to be enlightened, inspired, and humbled by the incredible individuals who call this sacred space their home.\n\nI extend my deepest gratitude to the Hijron ka Khanqah and its incredible community for their unwavering dedication to promoting inclusivity and spreading love.
