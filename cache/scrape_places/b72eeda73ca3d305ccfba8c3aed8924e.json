Then the trustee (fake owner) of the mosque, an old man with little knowledge, hit me hard on the head and before I could understand anything, he hit me again. When I looked at him, he said, go ahead and sit down. He said, why is there a need to hit me, so I put another one. I knew a little about the mosque and sat in front without saying anything. In the gathering of so many people, that ignorant old man hit me in the house of Allah, God is witness, what was my mistake, I, a traveler, came to the mosque to offer namaz without permission.
