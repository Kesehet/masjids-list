In my view most convenient transportation to this place is 2 wheeler vehicles. Vijayawada railway station is quite nearby.\n\nGood about the masjid is they are providing Islamic education to khawateen (Female). Definitely it was good move by the masjid responsible people. Such programs are needed in all the masjids of vijayawada. Those who gain Islamic elm from such places, we pray they spread tawheed with in their house and then rest palace's (ameen).",
