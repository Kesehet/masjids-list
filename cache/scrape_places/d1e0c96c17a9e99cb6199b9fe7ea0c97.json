Our rich past can be seen here peeping through the broken rocks.\nThe sculptures of Belbute, various animals, gods, snakes and men and women are carved in stone with such beauty that it cannot be believed that these are man-made.\nThe vastness of the temple and the vast size of the area forces one to think about how it might have been constructed 800 years ago. How the huge stones might have been raised to the height.\nNo matter how much you imagine or whatever I write, it will be less for this temple.\nThis temple dedicated to the Sun God was built in the shape of a chariot with seven horses symbolizing the seven colors of sunlight, which is now in a ruined state.\nThis chariot-shaped temple has 24 wheels which symbolize 24 dynamic hours (night and day = 24 hours).\nThere are 8 sections attached to each wheel of the chariot, which are symbols of the 8 hours. There are different crafts inscribed on each wheel, which are related to social life, society, family, devotion, governance, penance, war, etc. Each wheel is depicted differently from the other.

You can enjoy the beauty of stone arts and attractive green nature around it. Like the other temples of Odisha this temple also has story. The architecture of this temple is very detailed. The iron pillar, the wheels and the whole structure of this temple is so mesmerizing. But many of them are broken. In the evening you can enjoy the light and sound show. Do not forget to take a guide along if you are visiting the temple. Best time is between mid-November to mid-January.",

The beauty of the carved stones is so great, especially on the wheels, that it makes you wonder how it was built without any modern-day machines.\nIf possible, take a guide along or read beforehand about the temple and the meaning of the design of the wheels. This way, you'll enjoy your visit more as it will make more sense when you look at the architecture and carvings.\nSince we get to see the temple from outside only, it takes about one hour to see it completely. The entry ticket is priced at INR 40 for Indians and INR 600 for foreigners.",
