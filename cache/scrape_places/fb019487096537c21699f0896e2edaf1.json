If you want anything, please let me know.\"\n\nMother said... I don't want anything son...\"\n\nWhen the son repeatedly insisted, the mother said, \"Okay, you wait, I will write to you right now.\n\nAfter some time, the mother wrote something and handed a paper to the son.\n\nWhile sitting on the driving seat of the car, the son said to his wife, \"Look, mother also wanted something, but she was not saying. On my insistence, she has made a list. Apart from food and clothes, a person needs many things in life. Something is needed.\"\n\nOkay Baba, okay, but first I will take all the things I need. Later you keep looking at your mother's list...wife said.\n\nBoth of them left for the market in the car.\n\nAfter doing all the shopping for four hours, the wife said, \"Now I am very tired, I sit in the car with the AC on, you buy your mother's stuff after looking at her list.\" What has mother ordered for this festival...please tell me too?\n\nThe husband handed over the paper given by his mother to his wife.\n\nOh My God! Such a long list. Don't know what has been ordered? And become Shravan Kumar, saying this the wife started looking at her husband angrily and handed him the list back.\n\nBut what is this?\n\nThere were tears in the husband's eyes... and the hand holding the list was trembling like a dry leaf... his whole body was unconscious.\n\nhis wife b\n\nHutt got scared. What happened, what has your mother asked for? Saying this she snatched the slip from her husband's hand...\n\nThe wife was also surprised... because only a few words were written in such a big slip...\n\nIt was written in that paper...\n\n\"The pieces of my heart, the stars of my eyes, my dear son... I don't want anything on any festival, let alone on this festival. Still, you are insisting... If any of your city's If you find me in the shop, then take some moments of leisure for me... because now it is evening, I am beginning to fear the deepening darkness, I am beginning to fear loneliness, this old age of mine bites me, Now I am afraid of loneliness, so as long as I am alive, as long as I am breathing, as long as there is sound in my heartbeats, sit with me for a few moments, even if only for a while, share the loneliness of my old age. .... Without lighting the lamp, the dark evening of my life will become bright... Son, it has been so many years that I have not touched you. Once again, come and put your head in my lap and I will caress you with my loving palm. To the head. Once again my heart should be proud of finding my loved ones close, very close... and I will meet death with a smile... who knows whether I will survive till the next festival or not... !!\n\nBoth of them started crying...\n\n,\nFriends... our parents only need our love, our support, our respect and honor. Nothing else but that...!!\n\n",
