Naina Devi Temple is one of the main tourist attractions of Nainital and is a highly revered place for pilgrims. The lake area in Nainital is where all the main attractions of the city are found.\n\nNaina Devi Temple is situated on the top of Naina Hill on the northern bank of Naini Lake in Nainital, Uttarakhand. The main deity of the temple is Maa Naina Devi who is represented by two Netra or eyes. Nainital is one of the 64 Shaktipeeths also known as religious places of Hinduism.\n\nIn the olden days of history when Lord Shiva's wife Sati, unable to accept the insult by her father King Daksha for refusing to invite Sati and Lord Shiva to the Yagya, she burnt herself in the fire. Devastated and suffering from grief, when Lord Shiva was returning to his abode with her body in his arms, her body parts fell at various places on earth. The temple of Naina Devi is built at the place where the eyes (Naina) of the goddess are believed to have fallen when Lord Shiva was carrying her body.\n\nA very old temple believed to be built in the 15th century AD was rebuilt in 1883. Behind the temple there is a lake 167 yards wide and 93 feet deep. There is a huge Peepal tree on the left side of the temple gate. On the right side, there are idols of Lord Hanuman and Lord Ganesha. The 3 deities inside the temple are Maa Kali Devi, Maa Naina Devi and Lord Ganesha. Since 1918-19, every year on Bhadrapada Shukla Ashtami, the idol immersion ceremony is performed here, similar to the idol immersion ceremony celebrated in Maharashtra and West Bengal.",

Today we are going to tell you about one such temple located in Padampuri of Nainital district. An ancient temple of Pashan Devi (Pashan Devi Temple in Nainital) is situated on the top of the mountain. This temple is built inside a cave. This temple situated at an altitude of about 1800 to 2000 meters has many beliefs. It is believed that just by seeing the goddess in this temple one gets the happiness of children.\nYears ago, when a woman was going from the mountain towards Bhabhar with her child, then suddenly her child fell into the ditch from the place of that temple. When Pashan Devi appeared in the woman's dream at night, she told that her child was safe in the village of Chafi below and the next day the woman found her child. Since then the importance of this temple has increased even more.",
