Always carry a rain coat as weather is unpredictable.\n2. Keep your bag as light as possible if you want to trek at a good pace.\n3. Keep hydrating yourself and keep essential medicines such as of fever, loose motions, vomiting.\n4. Keep yourself cover well temperature drops immediate.\n\nOur Indian army is always there for the help if you fell any kind of discomfort do contact them there 5-10 metres away at every point.\nOverall the yatra was beautiful and cannot be described in words. The yatra open only in Savan month do have a registration before you go for yatra and do have a medical checkup which is mandatory for the yatra the you have to receive the RFID which you may get from locations decided in Jammu and shrinagar.\nThere are 2 routes one is from Pahalgam which will take you approx 2-3 days to complete the yatra as it is of approx 35-40km and rest point are provided.\nSecond is from Baltal which is approx 15-16km but very steep.\nSo if you want to visit sheshnaag lake you have to take the route from Pahalgam.\nSo this was our Journey to Shree Amarnath Ji Holy cave.",
