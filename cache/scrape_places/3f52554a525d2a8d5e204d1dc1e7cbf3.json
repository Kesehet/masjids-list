The Jama Masjid was regarded as a symbolic gesture of Islamic power across India well into the colonial era. The mosque predominantly uses red sandstone and is set apart from its predecessors by more extensive usage of white marble. Black marble also features as a decorative element. It is situated on a plinth elevated 10 meters above the surrounding city. The square sahn (courtyard) is paved with red sandstone and faces the eastern gate. It has a side length of at least 99 m and can accommodate 25,000 Muslims. The prayer hall measures 61 meters in length and 27 meters in breadth. Three marble domes rise up from its roof, featuring golden finials. The facade of the prayer hall features a grand pishtaq in the center, flanked by five smaller, cusped archways on either side. Above each archway of the prayer hall are some calligraphic pieces. The hall's interior bears seven mihrabs (prayer niches) on the western qibla wall, corresponding to the seven bays into which the hall is divided. The central mihrab is intricately decorated and clad in marble, with a marble minbar (pulpit) lying to its right. The hall is floored with white and black ornamented marble to look like a Muslim prayer mat.",
