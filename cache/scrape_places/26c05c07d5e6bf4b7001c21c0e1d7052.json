The mosque is one of the best places to visit in Delhi for anyone who loves history, art, or spirituality. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to experience the grace and glory of Mahadi Masjid Delhi.I was impressed by its architecture and history. The mosque is situated in the Archaeological Survey Park, about 500 meters south of Tomb and Mosque of Maulana Jamali Kamali. The mosque bears a strong resemblance with the Bara Gumbad Masjid of Lodi period. The mosque has a unique characteristic of an open wall mosque as well as a covered mosque. The flat roofed chambers of the mosque have been adorned with coloured tiles. The roofs have been adorned with arched openings. There are three central bays on the walls of the mosque. The courtyard has been well enclosed with strong walls and has turrets in each corner. The mosque thus looks like a miniature fortress.",
