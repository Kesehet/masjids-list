Wonderful place, not too many visitors since Khambhat is a bit out of the way. You could easily spend 3 - 4 hours here, especially if you like photography. Best time for photography would be early morning. I was here at noon and some areas were too bright while others were dark. See attached pics. One thing I liked about this place was that it did not have the generic 'restored by the ASI' look (like many masjids in Abad).",
