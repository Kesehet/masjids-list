It is too loud and we are not able to sleep or do our work when the prayer call is made..\n\nIn reply to your message asking me where I live.. Please come to 6th street and try and listen to your prayer call from here.. Infact it is loud... Just asking you to reduce it by a few decibels.. Am sure it would be hard for you..",

We are sorry for the inconvenience caused, but this is our way to call the locals and bypassers towards prayer. If you could let us know where you reside we will personally check with the sound level near your home.\nEdit: Checked the sound levels at AP block 6th street and confirmed the decibel level 15% below the allowed dB levels. You can contact the nearby police station authorities for the same as a copy has been submitted as well. Thank you.",
